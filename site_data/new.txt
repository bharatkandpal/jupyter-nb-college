Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[4] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber.[5]
Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock.[6] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely naturalized.[7][8][9] "Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia); these two closely related species are often confused.[10]

Names[edit]
Common chicory is also known as blue daisy, blue dandelion, blue sailors, blue weed, bunk, coffeeweed, cornflower, hendibeh, horseweed, ragged sailors, succory, wild bachelor's buttons, and wild endive.[11] (Note: "Cornflower" is commonly applied to Centaurea cyanus.)  Common names for varieties of var. foliosum include endive, radicchio, radichetta, Belgian endive, French endive, red endive, sugarloaf, and witloof (or witlof).

Description[edit]
When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem, from 30 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) tall.  The leaves are stalked, lanceolate and unlobed.  The flower heads are 2 to 4 cm (​1⁄4 to ​1 1⁄2 inches) wide, and usually light purple or lavender (see picture) and it has been described as light blue, rarely white or pink.  Of the two rows of involucral bracts, the inner is longer and erect, the outer is shorter and spreading. It flowers from July until October.  The achenes have no pappus (feathery hairs), but do have toothed scales on top.[12]

Culinary uses[edit]
Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been cultivated in Europe as a coffee substitute.[13] The roots are baked, roasted, ground, and used as an additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and southern United States, particularly in New Orleans. In France a mixture of 60% chicory and 40% coffee is sold as Ricoré. It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and during World War II in Continental Europe. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye, was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "East German coffee crisis" of 1976–79. It is also added to coffee in Spanish,  Greek, Turkish, Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian cuisines.[14]
Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to stouts (commonly expected to have a coffee-like flavour). Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.

Leaf chicory[edit]
Wild[edit]
Wild chicory leaves usually have a bitter taste. Their bitterness is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the Ligurian and Apulian regions of Italy and also in the southern part of India.  In Ligurian cuisine,  wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of preboggion and in Greek cuisine of horta; in the Apulian region, wild chicory leaves are combined with fava bean puree in the traditional local dish fave e cicorie selvatiche.[15] In Albania, the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of byrek.
By cooking and discarding the water, the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be sautéed with garlic, anchovies, and other ingredients. In this form, the resulting greens might be combined with pasta[16] or accompany meat dishes.[17]

Cultivated[edit]
Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as salad leaves. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:[18]

Radicchio usually has variegated red or red and green leaves. Some only refer to the white-veined red-leaved type as radicchio, also known as red endive and red chicory. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted. It can also be used to add color and zest to salads. It is largely used in Italy in different varieties, the most famous being the ones from Treviso (known as radicchio rosso di Treviso),[19][20] from Verona (radicchio di Verona), and Chioggia (radicchio di Chioggia), which are classified as an IGP.[21] It is also common in Greece.[citation needed]
Sugarloaf looks rather like cos lettuce, with tightly packed leaves.[22]
 Witloof, Belgian endive
Belgian endive is known in Dutch as witloof or witlof ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States,[23] indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of northern France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors in the absence of sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves.  It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour.  The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem at the bottom of the head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness.  Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium.[24] Today France is the largest producer of endive.[25]
Catalogna chicory (Cichorium intybus var. foliosum), also known as puntarelle, includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from radicchio)[26] of chicory and is used throughout Italy.
 Leaves unlobed and pointed

Although leaf chicory is often called "endive", true endive (Cichorium endivia) is a different species in the genus, distinct from Belgian endive.

Chicory root and inulin[edit]
Around 1970, it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin, a polysaccharide similar to starch. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon, etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power 10% that of sucrose[27] and is sometimes added to yogurts as a prebiotic. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble dietary fiber and functional food.[28]
Chicory root extract is a dietary supplement or food additive produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the insoluble fraction by filtration and centrifugation.   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of soluble fiber.  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% inulin, 14% sucrose, 5% cellulose, 6% protein, 4% ash, and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, about 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.[29]
Fresh chicory root may contain between 13 and 23% inulin, by total weight.[30]

Agents responsible for bitterness[edit]
The bitter substances are primarily the two sesquiterpene lactones, lactucin and lactucopicrin. Other ingredients are aesculetin, aesculin, cichoriin, umbelliferone, scopoletin, 6,7-dihydrocoumarin, and further sesquiterpene lactones and their glycosides.[31]

Chicory root contains essential oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus Tanacetum.[32]
In traditional medicine, chicory has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies.[33] According to Cancer Research UK, "essence therapists believe that using essences can help to increase your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing ... Essences are not used to prevent, control, or cure cancer or any other physical condition."[34]

Forage[edit]
Chicory is highly digestible for ruminants and has a low fiber concentration.[35] Chicory roots are an "excellent substitute for oats" for horses due to their protein and fat content.[36] Chicory contains a low quantity of reduced tannins[35] that may increase protein utilization efficiency in ruminants.
Some tannins reduce intestinal parasites.[37][38] Dietary chicory may be toxic to internal parasites, with studies of ingesting chicory by farm animals having lower worm burdens, leading to its use as a forage supplement.[39][40][41] Although chicory might have originated in France, Italy, and India,[42] much development of chicory for use with livestock has taken place in New Zealand.[43]

Forage chicory varieties[edit]

Puna (Grasslands Puna)
Developed in New Zealand, Grasslands Puna is well adapted to different climates, being grown from Alberta, Canada, to New Mexico and Florida. It is resistant to bolting, which leads to high nutrient levels in the leaves in spring. It also has high resistance to grazing.
Forage Feast
A variety from France used for human consumption and also for wildlife plots, where animals such as deer might graze. It is very cold-hardy, and being lower in tannins than other forage varieties, is suitable for human consumption.
Choice
Choice has been bred for high winter and early-spring growth activity, and lower amounts of lactucin and lactone, which are believed to taint milk. It is also use for seeding deer wildlife plots.
Oasis
Oasis was bred for increased lactone rates for the forage industry, and for higher resistance to fungal diseases such as Sclerotinia.[clarification needed]
Puna II
This variety is more winter-active than most others, which leads to greater persistence and longevity.
Grouse
A New Zealand variety, it is  used as a planting companion for forage brassicas. More prone to early flowering than other varieties, it has higher crowns more susceptible to overbrowsing.
Six Point
A United States variety, it is very similar to Puna.
History[edit]
The chicory plant is one of the earliest cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance").[44] In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importation of coffee into Prussia, leading to the development of a coffee substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Förster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795, 22 to 24 factories of this type were in Brunswick.[45][46] Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779[47] as the "chicoree", which the French cultivated as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France, chicory frequently appeared as an adulterant in coffee, or as a coffee substitute.[48] Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, has been on sale since 1885.
The cultivated chicory plant has a history reaching back to ancient Egyptian time.[citation needed] Medieval monks raised the plants and when coffee was introduced to Europe, the Dutch thought that chicory made a lively addition to the bean drink.
In the United States, chicory root has long been used as a substitute for coffee in prisons.[49] By the 1840s, the port of New Orleans was the second-largest importer of coffee (after New York).[48] Louisianans began to add chicory root to their coffee when Union naval blockades during the American Civil War cut off the port of New Orleans, thereby creating a long-standing tradition.[48]
A common meal in Rome, puntarelle, is made with chicory sprouts.[50] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports that chicory is a native plant of western Asia, North Africa, and Europe.[4]
Chicory is also mentioned in certain silk-growing texts. The primary caretaker of the silkworms, the "silkworm mother", should not eat or even touch it.[citation needed]
The chicory flower is often seen as inspiration for the Romantic concept of the Blue Flower (e.g. in German language Blauwarte ≈ blue lookout by the wayside). It could open locked doors, according to European folklore.[51]

Cichorium intybus, commonly known as chicory, is well known as a coffee substitute but is also widely used medicinally to treat various ailments ranging from wounds to diabetes. Although this plant has a rich history of use in folklore, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.1. IntroductionThe genus Cichorium (Asteraceae) consists of six species with major distribution areas in Europe and Asia [1]. In several Asteraceae, inulin, a β-2,1 linked fructose polymer with a terminal glucose residue, functions as a reserve carbohydrate in stems, tubers, and taproots [2]. Cichorium intybus L., commonly known as chicory, is an erect fairly woody perennial herb, around 1 m in height with a fleshy taproot of up to 75 cm in length and large basal leaves [1, 3]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the root of C. intybus contained up to 40% inulin, which has a negligible impact on blood sugar and thus is suitable for diabetics [4]. To date, C. intybus is grown for the production of inulin on an industrial scale [2]. The name of the plant is derived from Greek and Latin. Cichorium means field and intybus is partly derived from the Greek “to cut”, because of the leaves, and partly from the Latin tubus to indicate the hollow stem [5].Chicory is a hardy plant and can endure extreme temperatures during both vegetative and reproductive growth stages [1]. When broken, all plant parts exudate a milky latex [3]. Cichorium intybus is cultivated for numerous applications and can be divided into four main varieties or cultigroups according to their use [6]: (1) “industrial” or “root” chicory, predominantly cultivated in northwestern Europe, India, South Africa, and Chile, produces the taproot as a coffee substitute or for inulin extraction; (2) “Brussels” or “witloof” chicory is commonly cultivated around Europe as industrial chicory for etiolated buds (chicons) by forcing; (3) “leaf” chicory is used as fresh or cooked vegetables; and (4) “forage” chicory, initially derived from wild chicory commonly found along roadsides and waste areas, has been used since the mid-1970s to intensify herbage obtainability in perennial pastures for livestock.
Cichorium intybus is a medicinally important plant in Eurasia and in parts of Africa. Despite its long tradition of use, the plant is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in any official Pharmacopoeia of a European Union member state [5]. However, due to its prevalent distribution, different parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicines globally [7]. Important phytochemicals are distributed throughout the plant, but the main contents are present in the root [1]. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.2. Traditional UsesMedicinal plants have been used for centuries and numerous cultures still rely on indigenous medicinal plants to meet their primary health care needs. It is likely that the insightful knowledge of plant-based remedies in traditional cultures advanced through trial and error and that the most important cures were carefully passed from one generation to another [8]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant [9] and it has had a long history of therapeutic use both in areas where it is indigenous and in areas where it has been introduced. The various common or local names describing this plant may be ascribed to the widespread use by different folkloric groups. Different preparations of this plant are employed to treat various symptoms and ailments (Table 1). The juice is said to be a folk remedy for cancer of the uterus and for tumors [4]. In South Africa, although it is considered a widespread weed, leaves, stems, and roots are made into a tea for jaundice and chicory syrup is used as a tonic and purifying medicine for infants [3]. In Turkey, an ointment is made from the leaves for wound healing [10]. Decoction refers to a preparation that is made by adding cold water to the plant material which is then boiled and allowed to simmer for 5–10 min after which it is strained [8]. Chicory decoctions are traditionally made from individual plant parts and/or from the plant as a whole (Table 1).Table 1Traditional medicinal uses of Cichorium intybus.CountryTraditional use(s)Plant part(s)Preparation(s)ReferenceAfghanistanMalariaRootAqueous extract[12]

Prior to the wars in Afghanistan, folkloric reports described the use of aqueous root extracts as a light-sensitive plant remedy for malaria. This indigenous knowledge has since been confirmed and the antimalarial compounds of C. intybus roots have been identified as the light-sensitive sesquiterpene lactones lactucin and lactucopicrin [12]. The flowers of the chicory plant (Cichorii flos) are used as a herbal treatment of everyday ailments such as a tonic and appetite stimulant and as a treatment of gallstones, gastroenteritis, sinus problems, cuts, and bruises [4]. In Italy, the whorls are made into a decoction and used as a depurative [13]. Chicory seeds are one of the main ingredients of Jigrine, a commercial product of India used for the treatment of various diseases of the liver [14]. Other plant parts are also used for liver disorders, namely, aerial parts in Bosnia and Herzegovina [15] and roots in Serbia and India [16, 17].3. Chemical ConstituentsChicoric acid has been identified as the major compound in methanolic extracts of chicory (Table 2) [18]. Aliphatic compounds and their derivatives comprise the main fraction while terpenoids comprise minor constituents of the plant. The flowers of chicory contain saccharides, methoxycoumarin cichorine, flavonoids, essential oils [4], and anthocyanins contributing to the blue colour of the perianth [19]. Table 2 provides a summary of the compounds isolated and identified from chicory. Octane, n-nonadecane, pentadecanone, hexadecane, and a tentatively identified compound have been found as principal volatile components [4]. A list of volatile compounds is given in Table 3.Table 2Compounds isolated and identified from Cichorium intybus (chicory).CompoundReference(s)Lactucin [12, 31, 103] Lactucopicrin[12, 31]8-Deoxylactucin[31, 104]Jacquilenin[103]11β,13-Dihydrolactucin[103]11,13-Dihydrolactucopicrin[103, 104]Crepidiaside B [103]Cyanidin 3-O-p-(6-O-malonyl)-D-glucopyranoside[105]3,4β-Dihydro-15-dehydrolactucopicrin[103]Magnolialide[103]Ixerisoside D[103]Loliolide[103]Cichorioside B[103, 104]Sonchuside A[103, 104]Artesin [103]Cichoriolide[103]Cichorioside[103]Sonchuside C [103]Cichopumilide[103]Putrescine[83]Spermidine[83]

Cichorium intybus presents a little investigated plant in terms of phytochemistry and pharmacology. Over 100 individual compounds have been isolated and identified from this plant (Table 2), the majority of which are from the roots. Most of the pharmacological studies on this plant document the testing of aqueous and/or alcoholic extracts only. Apart from the pharmacologically important activities, the use of C. intybus (hairy root cultures) has also been implicated in the phytoremediation of DDT [20].4.1. Antimicrobial ActivityThe antibacterial activity of the organic acid-rich extract of fresh red chicory (C. intybus var. sylvestre) was tested against periodontopathic bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Prevotella intermedia. The compounds identified from the active extract include oxalic acid, succinic acid, quinic acid, and shikimic acid. All of the organic acids were found to decrease biofilm formation and adhesion of bacteria to the cells, with different levels of efficacy. These compounds also induced biofilm disruption and detachment of dead cells for the cultured substratum [21]. In other reports on the antimicrobial activity of C. intybus, the crude aqueous and organic seed extracts were found to be active against four pathogenic microorganisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, and root extracts had pronounced effects on Bacillus subtilis, S. aureus, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and E. coli [22, 23]. The leaf extract of C. intybus also showed a moderate activity against multidrug resistant S. typhi [24]. Guaianolides-rich root extracts of C. intybus have shown antifungal properties against anthropophilic fungi Trichophyton tonsurans, T. rubrum, and T. violaceum [25]. A sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin cichoralexin isolated from chicory exhibited potent antifungal activity against Pseudomonas cichorii [26].4.2. Anthelmintic ActivitySeveral studies have been conducted on grazing animals to determine the anthelmintic potential of secondary metabolites present in C. intybus. Grossly, it has been concluded that the animals grazing on chicory have a higher performance index and lower incidence of gastrointestinal nematode infestations. In the majority of the experiments, the condensed tannins and sesquiterpene lactones were responsible for anthelmintic activity [27]. Anthelmintic activity of chicory has also been noticed in the case of lambs wherein the total number of abomasal helminths was found to be lesser in the lambs grazing on this plant [28]. The condensed tannin and sesquiterpene-rich extracts of C. intybus were evaluated for their efficacy against the larvae of deer lungworm, Dictyocaulus viviparous and other gastrointestinal nematode larvae using a larval migration inhibition assay. A dose-dependent decrease in the larval motility was observed in both lungworm and gastrointestinal nematodes [29]. The sesquiterpene lactone-rich extracts of C. intybus were also found to inhibit egg hatching of Haemonchus contortus [30].4.3. Antimalarial ActivityThe infusion of fresh roots of C. intybus has a history of use as a remedy for malarial fevers in some parts of Afghanistan. The bitter compounds in the plant, namely, lactucin, lactucopicrin, and the guaianolide sesquiterpenes, isolated from aqueous root extracts of chicory were concluded to be the antimalarial components of the plant. Lactucin and lactucopicrin completely inhibited the HB3 clone of strain Honduras-1 of Plasmodium falciparum at concentrations of 10 and 50 μg/mL, respectively [12, 31].4.4. Hepatoprotective ActivityThe folkloric use of C. intybus as a hepatoprotectant has been well documented. It is one of the herbal components of Liv-52, a traditional Indian tonic used widely for hepatoprotection. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted on cirrhotic patients, Liv-52 medication reduced the serum levels of hepatic enzymes, namely, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. It also reduced the Child-Pugh scores and ascites significantly [32]. Another polyherbal formulation, Jigrine, contains the leaves of C. intybus as one of its 14 constituents. Jigrine was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activity against galactosamine-induced hepatopathy in rats. The pretreatment of male Wistar-albino rats with jigrine significantly reduced the levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and urea and increased the levels of blood and tissue glutathione. Histopathological examination of the liver revealed that jigrine pretreatment prevented galactosamine toxicity and caused a marked decrease in inflamed cells [33].The aqueous-methanolic extract of the seeds of C. intybus has been investigated for the hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in mice. It was found to decrease both the death rate and the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamyl pyruvate transaminase [34]. In analogous studies, the antihepatotoxic activity of the alcoholic extract of the seeds and aqueous extracts of the roots and root callus of C. intybus was estimated. The oral administration of these extracts in albino rats led to a marked decrease in the levels of hepatic enzymes. Also, histopathological examination of the liver showed no fat accumulation or necrosis after the treatment [14, 35]. Similar studies have established the hepatoprotective effect of esculetin, a phenolic compound, and cichotyboside, a guaianolide sesquiterpene glycoside reported from C. intybus [36, 37].The carbon tetrachloride and paracetamol-induced liver toxicities were also found to be counteracted by intraperitoneal administration of crude extracts and fractions of C. intybus. The methanol- and water-soluble fractions exhibited marked reductions in serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. In the same study, toxicity was induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with galactosamine and thioacetamide [38].The phenolic acid-rich seed extract of C. intybus was evaluated for its efficacy against hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro model of hepatic steatosis was created by incubation of the HepG2 cells with oleic acid leading to intracellular accumulation of fat. The seed extract was effective in decreasing the deposited fat from the cells in case of administration after the initial fat deposition (i.e., nonsimultaneous administration with oleic acid). However, in case of simultaneous administration of seed extract and oleic acid, the extract could not protect the cells from steatosis except at very high doses. The extract also led to the increased release of glycerol (an indicator of triglyceride degradation) in steatotic cells. In case of nonsimultaneous administration, the extract was found to upregulate the expression of SREBP-1c and PPAR-α genes leading to restoration of normal levels of corresponding proteins. In the in vivo model of hepatic steatosis, namely, diabetic rats, treatment with seed extract resulted in significant decrease in fat accumulation and fibrosis [39].The hepatoprotective activity of C. intybus has been correlated to its ability to inhibit the free radical mediated damage. A fraction prepared from the ethanolic extract of the leaves was assessed for preventive action on the free radical mediated damage to the deoxyribose sugar of the DNA (obtained from calf thymus). A dose-dependent decrease in the DNA damage was observed in the present assay [40].4.5. Antidiabetic ActivityChicory has reported antidiabetic activity [17, 41]. Based on the traditional use of C. intybus in diabetes mellitus, the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of the ethanol extract of the whole plant were investigated. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ethanol extract, at a dose of 125 mg/Kg body weight, significantly attenuated the serum glucose levels in the oral glucose tolerance test. A marked decrease in the serum triglycerides and cholesterol was also observed in the extract-treated rats. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found to be reduced in extract-treated diabetic rats as compared to untreated diabetic rats [17]. The antidiabetic effect of the aqueous seed extract of C. intybus has also been investigated. Early-stage and late-stage diabetes were differently induced in male Wistar albino rats by streptozotocin-niacinamide and streptozotocin alone, respectively. The treatment with chicory extract prevented weight loss in both early-stage and late-stage diabetic rats. Chicory-treated diabetic animals resisted excessive increase in fasting blood sugar (assessed by glucose tolerance test). Grossly, normalization of blood parameters, namely, alanine aminotransferase, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and glycosylated heamoglobin, was seen in these animals. In early-stage diabetic rats, chicory treatment led to the increase in insulin levels pointing toward the insulin-sensitizing action of chicory [42].Feeding the diabetic Wistar rats with C. intybus leaf powder led to a decrease in blood glucose levels to near normal value. C. intybus administration also decreased the malondialdehyde (formed by thiobarbituric acid) levels and increased glutathione content. Anticholinesterase activity was restored to near normal, brain lipopolysaccharide decreased, and catalase activity increased [43]. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid have been described as potential antidiabetic agents by increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells. Both compounds were also able to stimulate insulin secretion from an insulin-secreting cell line and islets of Langerhans. Another compound, chicoric acid, is also a new potential antidiabetic agent exhibiting both insulin-sensitizing and insulin-secreting properties [44].4.6. Gastroprotective Activity
C. intybus has been used in Turkish folklore for its antiulcerogenic potency. The aqueous decoction of C. intybus roots was orally administered to Sprague-Dawley rats 15 minutes before the induction of ulcerogenesis by ethanol. More than 95% inhibition of ulcerogenesis was observed in the test group [45].4.7. Anti-Inflammatory ActivityThe inhibition of TNF-α mediated cyclooxygenase (COX) induction by chicory root extracts was investigated in the human colon carcinoma (HT 29) cell line. The ethyl acetate extract inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-α mediated induction of COX-2 expression was also suppressed by the chicory extract [46].4.8. Analgesic ActivityLactucin, lactucopicrin, and 11β, 13-dihydrolactucin exhibited analgesic action in mice in hot plate and tail-flick tests. In the hot plate test, all three compounds exerted an analgesic effect, with lactucopicrin being the most potent compound. In the tail-flick test, the antinociceptive effects of all the tested compounds (30 mg/kg dose) were comparable to that of ibuprofen (60 mg/kg dose). Lactucin and lactucopicrin were also established to have some sedative action as evident from the decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in mice [47].4.9. Antioxidant ActivityThe DPPH radical scavenging activity of a polyphenols-rich fraction of C. intybus has been investigated [48]. The anti- and prooxidant activities of Cichorium species were studied in chemical as well as biological systems. In the case of chemical systems, the antioxidant activity of water-soluble compounds in C. intybus var. silvestre was established in the coupled model of linoleic acid and β-carotene. A pro-oxidant activity of some of the chemical components was recorded initially which notably diminished with time and/or thermal treatment. Thereafter, the antioxidant activity of the raw juice and its fractions persisted. The molecular weight ranges of the antioxidant fractions of raw juice were also identified based on dialysis [49]. Two varieties of chicory, namely, C. intybus var. silvestre and C. intybus var. foliosum, have been investigated for their antioxidant (antiradical) activities in two distinct biological systems. The lipid peroxidation assay has been carried out on microsome membranes of rat hepatocytes after the induction of oxidative damage by carbon tetrachloride. The antiradical activity was expressed as the protective activity against lipid peroxidation and calculated as the percentage decrease in hydroperoxide degradation products. The second biological system used was the cultures of S. aureus after treatment with cumene hydroperoxide. The percentage increase of growth of bacteria was noted after the treatment with juices of chicory varieties. In both systems, the juices of chicory varieties showed strong antiradical activities [21, 49].Red chicory (C. intybus var. silvestre) was studied for its polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by using the synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical and three model reactions catalyzed by pertinent enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species, namely, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and diaphorase. Total phenolics were significantly correlated with the antioxidant activity evaluated with both the synthetic radical and the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. On a molar basis, red chicory phenolics were as efficient as Trolox (reference compound) in scavenging the synthetic radical [50]. The aqueous-alcoholic extracts of the aerial parts of C. intybus also inhibited xanthine oxidase enzyme dose dependently [51]. In another study, along with DPPH radical scavenging activity, C. intybus also exhibited inhibition of hydrogen peroxide and chelation of ferrous ion [52].4.10. Tumor-Inhibitory ActivityThe crude ethanolic extract of C. intybus roots caused a significant inhibition of Ehrlich tumor carcinoma in mice. A 70% increase in the life span was observed with a 500 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal dose of the tested extract [53]. The aqueous-alcoholic macerate of the leaves of C. intybus also exerted an antiproliferative effect on amelanotic melanoma C32 cell lines [54]. Magnolialide, a 1β-hydroxyeudesmanolide isolated from the roots of C. intybus, inhibited several tumor cell lines and induced the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells to monocyte or macrophage-like cells [55].4.11. Antiallergic ActivityThe aqueous extract of C. intybus inhibited the mast cell-mediated immediate allergic reactions in vitro as well as in vivo. This extract restrained the systemic anaphylactic reaction in mice in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction caused by anti-dinitrophenyl IgE in rats. Other markers of allergic reaction, namely, plasma histamine levels and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, decreased significantly whereas the levels of cAMP increased after the treatment with C. intybus extract [56].4.12. Other Pharmacologically Important ActivitiesThe ethanol extract of the roots of C. intybus is reported to prevent the immunotoxic effects of ethanol in ICR mice. It was noted that body weight gains were markedly decreased in mice administered with ethanol. However, the body weight was not affected when ethanol was coadministered with the ethanol extract of C. intybus. Similarly, the weights of liver and spleen were not affected when ethanol extract was given along with ethanol. A considerable restoration in the other markers of immunity, namely, hemagglutination titer, plaque forming cells of spleen, secondary IgG antibody production, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (in response to subcutaneous administration of sheep red-blood cells to paw), phagocytic activity, number of circulating leucocytes, NK cell activity, cell proliferation, and production of interferon-γ, was registered [57]. The immunoactive potential of an aqueous-alcoholic extract of the roots was established by a mitogen proliferation assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The extract showed an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of phytohemagglutinin and a stimulatory effect on MLR [58].Chicoric acid has shown vasorelaxant activity against nor-epinephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta strips [59]. A pronounced anticholinesterase activity of the dichloromethane extract of C. intybus roots was seen in the enzyme assay with Ellman's reagent. Two sesquiterpene lactones, namely, 8-deoxylactucin and lactucopicrin, also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of anticholinesterase [60]. The methanolic extract displays wound healing effect and β-sitosterol was determined as the active compound responsible for the activity, possibly due to its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibition [7].5. Toxicological StudiesAlthough C. intybus has a long history of human use, the high levels of secondary metabolites have shown potential toxicological effects. To evaluate the safety of the root extract of C. intybus, Ames test and subchronic toxicity assessment were conducted. The sesquiterpene-rich extract was evaluated for potential mutagenic properties (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA1535 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. Though cytotoxicity was observed at high extract doses in some strains, mutagenicity was not noted. A 28-day (subchronic) oral toxicity study, conducted in CRL:CD (SD) IGS BR rats, concluded that there was no extract-related mortality or any other signs of toxicological significance [61]. The toxicity evaluation of C. intybus extracts has also been done by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test (Microtox acute toxicity test). This bacterial test measures the decrease in light emission from the marine luminescent bacteria V. fischeri when exposed to organic extracts. The tested extracts showed less than 20% inhibition of bioluminescence and hence were concluded to be safe for human use [54].6. Clinical TrialsTwo clinical studies on chicory roots are reported in the literature, both of which are pilot studies and are therefore considered to be insufficient to support a well-established use indication for chicory root [5]. The first study, a phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating trial, was conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) [62]. In general, the treatment was well tolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highest dose of chicory had to discontinue treatment due to an adverse event. The results of the pilot study suggested that a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root has a potential role in the management of OA and merits further investigation. The second pilot study was conducted to assess whether chicory coffee consumption might confer cardiovascular benefits; thus, a clinical intervention was performed with 27 healthy volunteers, who consumed 300 mL chicory coffee daily for one week [63]. Depending on the inducer used for the aggregation test, the dietary intervention showed variable effects on platelet aggregation. Whole blood and plasma viscosity were both significantly reduced, along with serum MIF levels, after a week of chicory coffee intake. It was concluded that the full spectrum of the effects was unlikely to be attributed to a single phytochemical; nevertheless, the phenolics (including caffeic acid) are expected to play a substantial role. The study offered an encouraging starting-point to describe the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds found in chicory coffee.In the European Union, there is currently only one registered/authorized herbal medicinal product containing C. intybus as single ingredient whilst there are several combination products on the market [5]. The efficacy of herbal medicine Liv-52 consisting of Mandur bhasma, Tamarix gallica, and herbal extracts of Capparis spinosa, C. intybus, Solanum nigrum, Terminalia arjuna, and Achillea millefolium on liver cirrhosis outcomes was compared with the placebo for 6 months in 36 cirrhotic patients. The study concluded that Liv-52 possessed a hepatoprotective effect in cirrhotic patients. This protective effect of Liv-52 can be attributed to the diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulating properties of the component herbs [32].7. Cultivation and Sustainable UseGreeks and Romans began to grow chicory as a vegetable crop 4000 years ago [9]. Since the discovery in the 1970s that chicory root contains up to 40% inulin (polysaccharide), new strains have been created, with inulin content comparable to that of sugar beet [4]. It is a common vegetable in several Western European countries. It is typically grown in a biennial cycle, with a tuberised root produced during the vegetative growth phase [64]. During the first field year, the vegetative growth phase is characterized by the production of a fleshy taproot. The second field year is the generative phase in which the flowering stem is formed and seeds are produced. To produce the eatable leafy vegetable called a chicon, roots are harvested at the end of the first growing period when an appropriate stage of maturity is reached [65]. The application of inulin in the food industry was restricted to the production of coffee substitutes. It was later discovered that inulin could act as a substitute for sugar or fat due to its low caloric value. The most stable form for the commercialization of inulin is the powdered extract for its greater facility of manipulation, transport, storage, and consumption [66].Chicory is especially attractive as a cash crop since it can reach more than 62 t ha−1 under favourable conditions. Inulin content can reach on average 15% of root fresh weight and a yield of 8 t ha−1 of inulin is achievable [67]. The USA imports more than 2.3 million kilograms of chicons and 1.9 million kilograms of roasted chicory roots for coffee according to 2002 US Department of Commerce tariff and trade data [61]. Numerous studies have focused on different cultivation aspects of chicory. Chicory is considered one of the most important sources of inulin since it has a high root yield potential and also a high root sugar content [68]. A high root yield, a high inulin content, and especially long inulin chains are preferred [69]. Short chain inulin is used for the production of fructose syrup used in sweetening of cold drinks whereas long chain inulin is used as fat replacer and foam stabilizer in food products and also in the production of carboxymethyl inulin [2]. The effect of fertilizers on the growth, development, and yield of chicory has been well studied. In general, increase of nitrogen (N) increases the growth and ultimately the yield, although a high application of N has a negative effect on especially some of the amino acids. Increased N application at levels of 200 kg N ha−1 leads to a decrease in amino acids such as threonine and valine with a pronounced decreased effect on methionine. A level of 100 kg N ha−1 is preferred for enhanced quality [70]. In terms of phosphorous (P), it has been established that chicory has at least two inherent patterns of response to low or zero P conditions. One pattern is the classical increase in the length of the smallest diameter roots in response to P deficient conditions. The second pattern is a significant decrease in root tissue density under low P conditions [71]. It has also been investigated as a suitable catch crop since it has the ability to withdraw N, especially nitrate, from the soil, thereby reducing potential leaching. Additionally, it can withstand competition, has a slow juvenile development and vigorous growth after harvest of the main crop, is frost- and winter-hardy, has a well-developed root system, and does not transmit pathogens or pests to other crops [72]. Canopy closure in chicory is advantageous and critical for yield and can be achieved by a larger supply of assimilates to the shoot [73].Chicory is greatly influenced by the pH of the soil as this affects the availability of nutrients in the soil to the plant. A study conducted by Anguissola Scotti el al. [74] on two soils of pH, 5.7 and 7.0 indicated that the fly-ash or metal availability to the plant was significantly different at the different pH levels. At a low pH a decrease of Zn, Cu, Cd, and Ni was observed and for neutral soils the added metals are more available to plants than those naturally occurring in soils [75]. Chicory is a cold-requiring long-day plant [72]. In a study by Amaducci and Pritoni [68], it was shown that retarding harvest time significantly affects the content and concentration of inulin. Rainfall has proven to be another important factor since the roots contain a higher water content, thereby affecting the concentration of inulin in the roots. The same results have been obtained in a study by Baert [69] where an early sowing date and harvesting time increased the root yield, total sugar content, and inulin chain length. The increase in yield with an earlier sowing date was up to 30% higher with an increase of 10% with an earlier harvest date. The content of free fructose and sucrose increased and the content of free glucose and inulin decreased with a later harvest time [75].Even though chicory is a cold-requiring plant, cold storage after harvest can cause a strong decrease in free glucose, an increase in free fructose and sucrose, and hydrolysis of inulin [76]. This has also been observed by Ernst et al. [77] where an onset of cooler temperatures and especially colder temperatures during storage resulted in an increase in sucrose and fructose content. It was found that sucrose increased in the roots of chicory about threefold and fructose increased about tenfold within the first few weeks of cold storage after harvest [77]. The effect of storage at reduced temperature has also been studied on the levels of sesquiterpene lactones. Storage at 2°C and 10°C for up to 13 days had no effect on the level of lactucin-like sesquiterpene lactones in the chicons and after 7 days of storage a slight increase of lactucopicrin content was observed [78]. Several types of discoloration, leaf edge damage, and extensive growth of the internal core can occur in the heads of chicory during postharvest storage, which considerably reduces their market value. An atmospheric composition of 10% O2 and 10% CO2 in combination with a storage temperature of 5°C was found optimal [64]. Low temperature in the field also hastens and enhances bolting and flowering [79, 80]. The type and cultivar have been identified in numerous studies to be the determining factor during the stages of growth [81]. Suhonen [82] found the highest numbers of bolters in those being planted last, for which the mean temperatures during early growth were the highest.During the postharvest period, the major polyamines present are putrescine, especially in the oldest leaves, although spermidine is present in considerable amounts, showing a tendency to decrease with the increasing physiological age of the leaves. Free sterol content increases with postharvest and also with physiological age of the leaves. Sitosterol is the major free sterol present, followed by stigmasterol and campesterol [83].Emergence has been reported as one negative aspect of the crop, which could be addressed by specific breeding programmes [68]. Chicory can also be propagated and grown by means of micropropagation by regeneration of meristematic nodules. The leaves are cultivated in vitro and develop into plantlets when transferred to soil [84]. Although chicory can be regenerated in vitro from explants, both through organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, and from protoplasts, no transgenic plants have yet been reported that have been produced [85]. Promising potential utility technologies of the plant have emerged. Chicory roots pulps are an important by-product of the inulin processing industries and are usually used in animal feed. Other applications can be found for these materials since the extraction of chicory pulp yields high levels of pectin, a polysaccharide extensively used in food as a gelling agent, thickening agent, and stabilizer [86]. The crude protein content in chicory is more valuable than in alfalfa. Furthermore the crude lipid in chicory is generally higher than most varieties of alfalfa [9]. It also has a nutritional quality comparable to lucerne, with a mineral content superior for copper and zinc, with similar proportions of protein, lipid, minerals, and other nutrients, and palatable with good digestion with applicability in the poultry and livestock industry [87, 88].8. Conclusion
Cichorium intybus has a long tradition of use globally. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. This multipurpose plant contains high amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and mineral elements [9]. Inulin from chicory roots is considered a functional food ingredient as it affects physiological and biochemical processes resulting in better health and reduction of the risk of many diseases [89].To date, chicory remains an extremely versatile plant, amenable to genetic manipulation, and there is interest shown in genetically engineered chicory to obtain higher yields and create new potentials [1]. The documented indigenous knowledge relating to the various medicinal uses of chicory has been supported by phytochemical isolation and investigations into biological activity. Nonetheless, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential and further research is necessary to gain better understanding of the phytochemicals against various diseases [9]. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited; however, considering that the Asteraceae family is a known source of allergic problems, a contraindication for hypersensitivity should be included in the safety data [5]. Recent studies suggest the use of C. intybus as a biomonitor for heavy metals [90, 91]; considering that chicory enters the food chain, this plant should be used with caution. The apparent bioactivity of C. intybus shown in preclinical studies (both in vitro and in vivo) is a testament to its historical use in traditional medicine.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThe South African Medical Research Council, University of South Africa and the HOD, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India, are thanked for their support.References1.

It is popularly known as chicory and sometimes also referred to as blue sailors or succory. This plant has many varieties that are cultivated throughout the world. Chicory is native to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, northern and southern Africa and America.
The chicory root is significant for its use as a coffee substitute and additive. Furthermore its leaves are used in the preparation of salads and can also be cooked and eaten.
Chichorium Intybus is also regarded as a miracle herb that has been famous ever since for its medicinal uses.
Cichorium Intybus Description
The beauty of the Chicory plant is as mystic as the legends associated with it.
Stem: When the plant starts to bloom, the stems appear sturdy, grooved and more or less hairy. These stems are approximately 30-100 centimeters in height.
Leaf: The plant leaves do not have lobes and are narrow and tapering, somewhat like a pointed apex in appearance. Another noteworthy characteristic about the leaves is that they are stalked.
Flower: The flowers of the chichorium intybus appear bright blue, with a hint of purple color. However in rare scenarios the flowers may also be white or pink. The pretty flower heads are about 2-4 centimeters wide. The two rows of bracts protecting the inflorescence are conspicuously evident with the long and erect inner bracts and comparatively shorter outer bracts. The plant blooms in the time period between July and October. It is interesting to note how these flowers open up and expand in the morning and close up as noon approaches. It is also equally astonishing how each bloom can last only for one single day!
Fruit: The fruits or achenes are distinguished by the toothed scales on the apex. These plant fruits do not have calyx or feathery hairs on the body.

Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[4] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber.[5]
Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock.[6] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely naturalized.[7][8][9] "Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia); these two closely related species are often confused.[10]

Names[edit]
Common chicory is also known as blue daisy, blue dandelion, blue sailors, blue weed, bunk, coffeeweed, cornflower, hendibeh, horseweed, ragged sailors, succory, wild bachelor's buttons, and wild endive.[11] (Note: "Cornflower" is commonly applied to Centaurea cyanus.)  Common names for varieties of var. foliosum include endive, radicchio, radichetta, Belgian endive, French endive, red endive, sugarloaf, and witloof (or witlof).

Description[edit]
When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem, from 30 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) tall.  The leaves are stalked, lanceolate and unlobed.  The flower heads are 2 to 4 cm (​1⁄4 to ​1 1⁄2 inches) wide, and usually light purple or lavender (see picture) and it has been described as light blue, rarely white or pink.  Of the two rows of involucral bracts, the inner is longer and erect, the outer is shorter and spreading. It flowers from July until October.  The achenes have no pappus (feathery hairs), but do have toothed scales on top.[12]

Culinary uses[edit]
Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been cultivated in Europe as a coffee substitute.[13] The roots are baked, roasted, ground, and used as an additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and southern United States, particularly in New Orleans. In France a mixture of 60% chicory and 40% coffee is sold as Ricoré. It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and during World War II in Continental Europe. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye, was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "East German coffee crisis" of 1976–79. It is also added to coffee in Spanish,  Greek, Turkish, Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian cuisines.[14]
Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to stouts (commonly expected to have a coffee-like flavour). Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.

Leaf chicory[edit]
Wild[edit]
Wild chicory leaves usually have a bitter taste. Their bitterness is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the Ligurian and Apulian regions of Italy and also in the southern part of India.  In Ligurian cuisine,  wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of preboggion and in Greek cuisine of horta; in the Apulian region, wild chicory leaves are combined with fava bean puree in the traditional local dish fave e cicorie selvatiche.[15] In Albania, the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of byrek.
By cooking and discarding the water, the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be sautéed with garlic, anchovies, and other ingredients. In this form, the resulting greens might be combined with pasta[16] or accompany meat dishes.[17]

Cultivated[edit]
Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as salad leaves. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:[18]

Radicchio usually has variegated red or red and green leaves. Some only refer to the white-veined red-leaved type as radicchio, also known as red endive and red chicory. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted. It can also be used to add color and zest to salads. It is largely used in Italy in different varieties, the most famous being the ones from Treviso (known as radicchio rosso di Treviso),[19][20] from Verona (radicchio di Verona), and Chioggia (radicchio di Chioggia), which are classified as an IGP.[21] It is also common in Greece.[citation needed]
Sugarloaf looks rather like cos lettuce, with tightly packed leaves.[22]
 Witloof, Belgian endive
Belgian endive is known in Dutch as witloof or witlof ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States,[23] indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of northern France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors in the absence of sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves.  It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour.  The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem at the bottom of the head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness.  Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium.[24] Today France is the largest producer of endive.[25]
Catalogna chicory (Cichorium intybus var. foliosum), also known as puntarelle, includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from radicchio)[26] of chicory and is used throughout Italy.
 Leaves unlobed and pointed
 Inflorescences of a blue-flowered form, note the two rows of bracts
Although leaf chicory is often called "endive", true endive (Cichorium endivia) is a different species in the genus, distinct from Belgian endive.

Chicory root and inulin[edit]
Around 1970, it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin, a polysaccharide similar to starch. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon, etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power 10% that of sucrose[27] and is sometimes added to yogurts as a prebiotic. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble dietary fiber and functional food.[28]
Chicory root extract is a dietary supplement or food additive produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the insoluble fraction by filtration and centrifugation.   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of soluble fiber.  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% inulin, 14% sucrose, 5% cellulose, 6% protein, 4% ash, and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, about 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.[29]
Fresh chicory root may contain between 13 and 23% inulin, by total weight.[30]

Agents responsible for bitterness[edit]
The bitter substances are primarily the two sesquiterpene lactones, lactucin and lactucopicrin. Other ingredients are aesculetin, aesculin, cichoriin, umbelliferone, scopoletin, 6,7-dihydrocoumarin, and further sesquiterpene lactones and their glycosides.[31]

Chicory root contains essential oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus Tanacetum.[32]
In traditional medicine, chicory has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies.[33] According to Cancer Research UK, "essence therapists believe that using essences can help to increase your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing ... Essences are not used to prevent, control, or cure cancer or any other physical condition."[34]

Forage[edit]
Chicory is highly digestible for ruminants and has a low fiber concentration.[35] Chicory roots are an "excellent substitute for oats" for horses due to their protein and fat content.[36] Chicory contains a low quantity of reduced tannins[35] that may increase protein utilization efficiency in ruminants.
Some tannins reduce intestinal parasites.[37][38] Dietary chicory may be toxic to internal parasites, with studies of ingesting chicory by farm animals having lower worm burdens, leading to its use as a forage supplement.[39][40][41] Although chicory might have originated in France, Italy, and India,[42] much development of chicory for use with livestock has taken place in New Zealand.[43]

Forage chicory varieties[edit]
This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Puna (Grasslands Puna)
Developed in New Zealand, Grasslands Puna is well adapted to different climates, being grown from Alberta, Canada, to New Mexico and Florida. It is resistant to bolting, which leads to high nutrient levels in the leaves in spring. It also has high resistance to grazing.
Forage Feast
A variety from France used for human consumption and also for wildlife plots, where animals such as deer might graze. It is very cold-hardy, and being lower in tannins than other forage varieties, is suitable for human consumption.
Choice
Choice has been bred for high winter and early-spring growth activity, and lower amounts of lactucin and lactone, which are believed to taint milk. It is also use for seeding deer wildlife plots.
Oasis
Oasis was bred for increased lactone rates for the forage industry, and for higher resistance to fungal diseases such as Sclerotinia.[clarification needed]
Puna II
This variety is more winter-active than most others, which leads to greater persistence and longevity.
Grouse
A New Zealand variety, it is  used as a planting companion for forage brassicas. More prone to early flowering than other varieties, it has higher crowns more susceptible to overbrowsing.
Six Point
A United States variety, it is very similar to Puna.
History[edit]
The chicory plant is one of the earliest cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance").[44] In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importation of coffee into Prussia, leading to the development of a coffee substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Förster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795, 22 to 24 factories of this type were in Brunswick.[45][46] Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779[47] as the "chicoree", which the French cultivated as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France, chicory frequently appeared as an adulterant in coffee, or as a coffee substitute.[48] Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, has been on sale since 1885.
The cultivated chicory plant has a history reaching back to ancient Egyptian time.[citation needed] Medieval monks raised the plants and when coffee was introduced to Europe, the Dutch thought that chicory made a lively addition to the bean drink.
In the United States, chicory root has long been used as a substitute for coffee in prisons.[49] By the 1840s, the port of New Orleans was the second-largest importer of coffee (after New York).[48] Louisianans began to add chicory root to their coffee when Union naval blockades during the American Civil War cut off the port of New Orleans, thereby creating a long-standing tradition.[48]
A common meal in Rome, puntarelle, is made with chicory sprouts.[50] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports that chicory is a native plant of western Asia, North Africa, and Europe.[4]
Chicory is also mentioned in certain silk-growing texts. The primary caretaker of the silkworms, the "silkworm mother", should not eat or even touch it.[citation needed]
The chicory flower is often seen as inspiration for the Romantic concept of the Blue Flower (e.g. in German language Blauwarte ≈ blue lookout by the wayside). It could open locked doors, according to European folklore.[51]

Cichorium intybus, commonly known as chicory, is well known as a coffee substitute but is also widely used medicinally to treat various ailments ranging from wounds to diabetes. Although this plant has a rich history of use in folklore, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.1. IntroductionThe genus Cichorium (Asteraceae) consists of six species with major distribution areas in Europe and Asia [1]. In several Asteraceae, inulin, a β-2,1 linked fructose polymer with a terminal glucose residue, functions as a reserve carbohydrate in stems, tubers, and taproots [2]. Cichorium intybus L., commonly known as chicory, is an erect fairly woody perennial herb, around 1 m in height with a fleshy taproot of up to 75 cm in length and large basal leaves [1, 3]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the root of C. intybus contained up to 40% inulin, which has a negligible impact on blood sugar and thus is suitable for diabetics [4]. To date, C. intybus is grown for the production of inulin on an industrial scale [2]. The name of the plant is derived from Greek and Latin. Cichorium means field and intybus is partly derived from the Greek “to cut”, because of the leaves, and partly from the Latin tubus to indicate the hollow stem [5].Chicory is a hardy plant and can endure extreme temperatures during both vegetative and reproductive growth stages [1]. When broken, all plant parts exudate a milky latex [3]. Cichorium intybus is cultivated for numerous applications and can be divided into four main varieties or cultigroups according to their use [6]: (1) “industrial” or “root” chicory, predominantly cultivated in northwestern Europe, India, South Africa, and Chile, produces the taproot as a coffee substitute or for inulin extraction; (2) “Brussels” or “witloof” chicory is commonly cultivated around Europe as industrial chicory for etiolated buds (chicons) by forcing; (3) “leaf” chicory is used as fresh or cooked vegetables; and (4) “forage” chicory, initially derived from wild chicory commonly found along roadsides and waste areas, has been used since the mid-1970s to intensify herbage obtainability in perennial pastures for livestock.
Cichorium intybus is a medicinally important plant in Eurasia and in parts of Africa. Despite its long tradition of use, the plant is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in any official Pharmacopoeia of a European Union member state [5]. However, due to its prevalent distribution, different parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicines globally [7]. Important phytochemicals are distributed throughout the plant, but the main contents are present in the root [1]. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.2. Traditional UsesMedicinal plants have been used for centuries and numerous cultures still rely on indigenous medicinal plants to meet their primary health care needs. It is likely that the insightful knowledge of plant-based remedies in traditional cultures advanced through trial and error and that the most important cures were carefully passed from one generation to another [8]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant [9] and it has had a long history of therapeutic use both in areas where it is indigenous and in areas where it has been introduced. The various common or local names describing this plant may be ascribed to the widespread use by different folkloric groups. Different preparations of this plant are employed to treat various symptoms and ailments (Table 1). The juice is said to be a folk remedy for cancer of the uterus and for tumors [4]. In South Africa, although it is considered a widespread weed, leaves, stems, and roots are made into a tea for jaundice and chicory syrup is used as a tonic and purifying medicine for infants [3]. In Turkey, an ointment is made from the leaves for wound healing [10]. Decoction refers to a preparation that is made by adding cold water to the plant material which is then boiled and allowed to simmer for 5–10 min after which it is strained [8]. Chicory decoctions are traditionally made from individual plant parts and/or from the plant as a whole (Table 1).Table 1Traditional medicinal uses of Cichorium intybus.CountryTraditional use(s)Plant part(s)Preparation(s)ReferenceAfghanistanMalariaRootAqueous extract[12]

Prior to the wars in Afghanistan, folkloric reports described the use of aqueous root extracts as a light-sensitive plant remedy for malaria. This indigenous knowledge has since been confirmed and the antimalarial compounds of C. intybus roots have been identified as the light-sensitive sesquiterpene lactones lactucin and lactucopicrin [12]. The flowers of the chicory plant (Cichorii flos) are used as a herbal treatment of everyday ailments such as a tonic and appetite stimulant and as a treatment of gallstones, gastroenteritis, sinus problems, cuts, and bruises [4]. In Italy, the whorls are made into a decoction and used as a depurative [13]. Chicory seeds are one of the main ingredients of Jigrine, a commercial product of India used for the treatment of various diseases of the liver [14]. Other plant parts are also used for liver disorders, namely, aerial parts in Bosnia and Herzegovina [15] and roots in Serbia and India [16, 17].3. Chemical ConstituentsChicoric acid has been identified as the major compound in methanolic extracts of chicory (Table 2) [18]. Aliphatic compounds and their derivatives comprise the main fraction while terpenoids comprise minor constituents of the plant. The flowers of chicory contain saccharides, methoxycoumarin cichorine, flavonoids, essential oils [4], and anthocyanins contributing to the blue colour of the perianth [19]. Table 2 provides a summary of the compounds isolated and identified from chicory. Octane, n-nonadecane, pentadecanone, hexadecane, and a tentatively identified compound have been found as principal volatile components [4]. A list of volatile compounds is given in Table 3.Table 2Compounds isolated and identified from Cichorium intybus (chicory).CompoundReference(s)Lactucin [12, 31, 103] Lactucopicrin[12, 31]8-Deoxylactucin[31, 104]Jacquilenin[103]11β,13-Dihydrolactucin[103]11,13-Dihydrolactucopicrin[103, 104]Crepidiaside B [103]Cyanidin 3-O-p-(6-O-malonyl)-D-glucopyranoside[105]3,4β-Dihydro-15-dehydrolactucopicrin[103]Magnolialide[103]Ixerisoside D[103]Loliolide[103]Cichorioside B[103, 104]Sonchuside A[103, 104]Artesin [103]Cichoriolide[103]Cichorioside[103]Sonchuside C [103]Cichopumilide[103]Putrescine[83]Spermidine[83]

Cichorium intybus presents a little investigated plant in terms of phytochemistry and pharmacology. Over 100 individual compounds have been isolated and identified from this plant (Table 2), the majority of which are from the roots. Most of the pharmacological studies on this plant document the testing of aqueous and/or alcoholic extracts only. Apart from the pharmacologically important activities, the use of C. intybus (hairy root cultures) has also been implicated in the phytoremediation of DDT [20].4.1. Antimicrobial ActivityThe antibacterial activity of the organic acid-rich extract of fresh red chicory (C. intybus var. sylvestre) was tested against periodontopathic bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Prevotella intermedia. The compounds identified from the active extract include oxalic acid, succinic acid, quinic acid, and shikimic acid. All of the organic acids were found to decrease biofilm formation and adhesion of bacteria to the cells, with different levels of efficacy. These compounds also induced biofilm disruption and detachment of dead cells for the cultured substratum [21]. In other reports on the antimicrobial activity of C. intybus, the crude aqueous and organic seed extracts were found to be active against four pathogenic microorganisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, and root extracts had pronounced effects on Bacillus subtilis, S. aureus, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and E. coli [22, 23]. The leaf extract of C. intybus also showed a moderate activity against multidrug resistant S. typhi [24]. Guaianolides-rich root extracts of C. intybus have shown antifungal properties against anthropophilic fungi Trichophyton tonsurans, T. rubrum, and T. violaceum [25]. A sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin cichoralexin isolated from chicory exhibited potent antifungal activity against Pseudomonas cichorii [26].4.2. Anthelmintic ActivitySeveral studies have been conducted on grazing animals to determine the anthelmintic potential of secondary metabolites present in C. intybus. Grossly, it has been concluded that the animals grazing on chicory have a higher performance index and lower incidence of gastrointestinal nematode infestations. In the majority of the experiments, the condensed tannins and sesquiterpene lactones were responsible for anthelmintic activity [27]. Anthelmintic activity of chicory has also been noticed in the case of lambs wherein the total number of abomasal helminths was found to be lesser in the lambs grazing on this plant [28]. The condensed tannin and sesquiterpene-rich extracts of C. intybus were evaluated for their efficacy against the larvae of deer lungworm, Dictyocaulus viviparous and other gastrointestinal nematode larvae using a larval migration inhibition assay. A dose-dependent decrease in the larval motility was observed in both lungworm and gastrointestinal nematodes [29]. The sesquiterpene lactone-rich extracts of C. intybus were also found to inhibit egg hatching of Haemonchus contortus [30].4.3. Antimalarial ActivityThe infusion of fresh roots of C. intybus has a history of use as a remedy for malarial fevers in some parts of Afghanistan. The bitter compounds in the plant, namely, lactucin, lactucopicrin, and the guaianolide sesquiterpenes, isolated from aqueous root extracts of chicory were concluded to be the antimalarial components of the plant. Lactucin and lactucopicrin completely inhibited the HB3 clone of strain Honduras-1 of Plasmodium falciparum at concentrations of 10 and 50 μg/mL, respectively [12, 31].4.4. Hepatoprotective ActivityThe folkloric use of C. intybus as a hepatoprotectant has been well documented. It is one of the herbal components of Liv-52, a traditional Indian tonic used widely for hepatoprotection. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted on cirrhotic patients, Liv-52 medication reduced the serum levels of hepatic enzymes, namely, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. It also reduced the Child-Pugh scores and ascites significantly [32]. Another polyherbal formulation, Jigrine, contains the leaves of C. intybus as one of its 14 constituents. Jigrine was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activity against galactosamine-induced hepatopathy in rats. The pretreatment of male Wistar-albino rats with jigrine significantly reduced the levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and urea and increased the levels of blood and tissue glutathione. Histopathological examination of the liver revealed that jigrine pretreatment prevented galactosamine toxicity and caused a marked decrease in inflamed cells [33].The aqueous-methanolic extract of the seeds of C. intybus has been investigated for the hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in mice. It was found to decrease both the death rate and the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamyl pyruvate transaminase [34]. In analogous studies, the antihepatotoxic activity of the alcoholic extract of the seeds and aqueous extracts of the roots and root callus of C. intybus was estimated. The oral administration of these extracts in albino rats led to a marked decrease in the levels of hepatic enzymes. Also, histopathological examination of the liver showed no fat accumulation or necrosis after the treatment [14, 35]. Similar studies have established the hepatoprotective effect of esculetin, a phenolic compound, and cichotyboside, a guaianolide sesquiterpene glycoside reported from C. intybus [36, 37].The carbon tetrachloride and paracetamol-induced liver toxicities were also found to be counteracted by intraperitoneal administration of crude extracts and fractions of C. intybus. The methanol- and water-soluble fractions exhibited marked reductions in serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. In the same study, toxicity was induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with galactosamine and thioacetamide [38].The phenolic acid-rich seed extract of C. intybus was evaluated for its efficacy against hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro model of hepatic steatosis was created by incubation of the HepG2 cells with oleic acid leading to intracellular accumulation of fat. The seed extract was effective in decreasing the deposited fat from the cells in case of administration after the initial fat deposition (i.e., nonsimultaneous administration with oleic acid). However, in case of simultaneous administration of seed extract and oleic acid, the extract could not protect the cells from steatosis except at very high doses. The extract also led to the increased release of glycerol (an indicator of triglyceride degradation) in steatotic cells. In case of nonsimultaneous administration, the extract was found to upregulate the expression of SREBP-1c and PPAR-α genes leading to restoration of normal levels of corresponding proteins. In the in vivo model of hepatic steatosis, namely, diabetic rats, treatment with seed extract resulted in significant decrease in fat accumulation and fibrosis [39].The hepatoprotective activity of C. intybus has been correlated to its ability to inhibit the free radical mediated damage. A fraction prepared from the ethanolic extract of the leaves was assessed for preventive action on the free radical mediated damage to the deoxyribose sugar of the DNA (obtained from calf thymus). A dose-dependent decrease in the DNA damage was observed in the present assay [40].4.5. Antidiabetic ActivityChicory has reported antidiabetic activity [17, 41]. Based on the traditional use of C. intybus in diabetes mellitus, the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of the ethanol extract of the whole plant were investigated. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ethanol extract, at a dose of 125 mg/Kg body weight, significantly attenuated the serum glucose levels in the oral glucose tolerance test. A marked decrease in the serum triglycerides and cholesterol was also observed in the extract-treated rats. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found to be reduced in extract-treated diabetic rats as compared to untreated diabetic rats [17]. The antidiabetic effect of the aqueous seed extract of C. intybus has also been investigated. Early-stage and late-stage diabetes were differently induced in male Wistar albino rats by streptozotocin-niacinamide and streptozotocin alone, respectively. The treatment with chicory extract prevented weight loss in both early-stage and late-stage diabetic rats. Chicory-treated diabetic animals resisted excessive increase in fasting blood sugar (assessed by glucose tolerance test). Grossly, normalization of blood parameters, namely, alanine aminotransferase, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and glycosylated heamoglobin, was seen in these animals. In early-stage diabetic rats, chicory treatment led to the increase in insulin levels pointing toward the insulin-sensitizing action of chicory [42].Feeding the diabetic Wistar rats with C. intybus leaf powder led to a decrease in blood glucose levels to near normal value. C. intybus administration also decreased the malondialdehyde (formed by thiobarbituric acid) levels and increased glutathione content. Anticholinesterase activity was restored to near normal, brain lipopolysaccharide decreased, and catalase activity increased [43]. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid have been described as potential antidiabetic agents by increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells. Both compounds were also able to stimulate insulin secretion from an insulin-secreting cell line and islets of Langerhans. Another compound, chicoric acid, is also a new potential antidiabetic agent exhibiting both insulin-sensitizing and insulin-secreting properties [44].4.6. Gastroprotective Activity
C. intybus has been used in Turkish folklore for its antiulcerogenic potency. The aqueous decoction of C. intybus roots was orally administered to Sprague-Dawley rats 15 minutes before the induction of ulcerogenesis by ethanol. More than 95% inhibition of ulcerogenesis was observed in the test group [45].4.7. Anti-Inflammatory ActivityThe inhibition of TNF-α mediated cyclooxygenase (COX) induction by chicory root extracts was investigated in the human colon carcinoma (HT 29) cell line. The ethyl acetate extract inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-α mediated induction of COX-2 expression was also suppressed by the chicory extract [46].4.8. Analgesic ActivityLactucin, lactucopicrin, and 11β, 13-dihydrolactucin exhibited analgesic action in mice in hot plate and tail-flick tests. In the hot plate test, all three compounds exerted an analgesic effect, with lactucopicrin being the most potent compound. In the tail-flick test, the antinociceptive effects of all the tested compounds (30 mg/kg dose) were comparable to that of ibuprofen (60 mg/kg dose). Lactucin and lactucopicrin were also established to have some sedative action as evident from the decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in mice [47].4.9. Antioxidant ActivityThe DPPH radical scavenging activity of a polyphenols-rich fraction of C. intybus has been investigated [48]. The anti- and prooxidant activities of Cichorium species were studied in chemical as well as biological systems. In the case of chemical systems, the antioxidant activity of water-soluble compounds in C. intybus var. silvestre was established in the coupled model of linoleic acid and β-carotene. A pro-oxidant activity of some of the chemical components was recorded initially which notably diminished with time and/or thermal treatment. Thereafter, the antioxidant activity of the raw juice and its fractions persisted. The molecular weight ranges of the antioxidant fractions of raw juice were also identified based on dialysis [49]. Two varieties of chicory, namely, C. intybus var. silvestre and C. intybus var. foliosum, have been investigated for their antioxidant (antiradical) activities in two distinct biological systems. The lipid peroxidation assay has been carried out on microsome membranes of rat hepatocytes after the induction of oxidative damage by carbon tetrachloride. The antiradical activity was expressed as the protective activity against lipid peroxidation and calculated as the percentage decrease in hydroperoxide degradation products. The second biological system used was the cultures of S. aureus after treatment with cumene hydroperoxide. The percentage increase of growth of bacteria was noted after the treatment with juices of chicory varieties. In both systems, the juices of chicory varieties showed strong antiradical activities [21, 49].Red chicory (C. intybus var. silvestre) was studied for its polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by using the synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical and three model reactions catalyzed by pertinent enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species, namely, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and diaphorase. Total phenolics were significantly correlated with the antioxidant activity evaluated with both the synthetic radical and the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. On a molar basis, red chicory phenolics were as efficient as Trolox (reference compound) in scavenging the synthetic radical [50]. The aqueous-alcoholic extracts of the aerial parts of C. intybus also inhibited xanthine oxidase enzyme dose dependently [51]. In another study, along with DPPH radical scavenging activity, C. intybus also exhibited inhibition of hydrogen peroxide and chelation of ferrous ion [52].4.10. Tumor-Inhibitory ActivityThe crude ethanolic extract of C. intybus roots caused a significant inhibition of Ehrlich tumor carcinoma in mice. A 70% increase in the life span was observed with a 500 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal dose of the tested extract [53]. The aqueous-alcoholic macerate of the leaves of C. intybus also exerted an antiproliferative effect on amelanotic melanoma C32 cell lines [54]. Magnolialide, a 1β-hydroxyeudesmanolide isolated from the roots of C. intybus, inhibited several tumor cell lines and induced the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells to monocyte or macrophage-like cells [55].4.11. Antiallergic ActivityThe aqueous extract of C. intybus inhibited the mast cell-mediated immediate allergic reactions in vitro as well as in vivo. This extract restrained the systemic anaphylactic reaction in mice in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction caused by anti-dinitrophenyl IgE in rats. Other markers of allergic reaction, namely, plasma histamine levels and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, decreased significantly whereas the levels of cAMP increased after the treatment with C. intybus extract [56].4.12. Other Pharmacologically Important ActivitiesThe ethanol extract of the roots of C. intybus is reported to prevent the immunotoxic effects of ethanol in ICR mice. It was noted that body weight gains were markedly decreased in mice administered with ethanol. However, the body weight was not affected when ethanol was coadministered with the ethanol extract of C. intybus. Similarly, the weights of liver and spleen were not affected when ethanol extract was given along with ethanol. A considerable restoration in the other markers of immunity, namely, hemagglutination titer, plaque forming cells of spleen, secondary IgG antibody production, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (in response to subcutaneous administration of sheep red-blood cells to paw), phagocytic activity, number of circulating leucocytes, NK cell activity, cell proliferation, and production of interferon-γ, was registered [57]. The immunoactive potential of an aqueous-alcoholic extract of the roots was established by a mitogen proliferation assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The extract showed an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of phytohemagglutinin and a stimulatory effect on MLR [58].Chicoric acid has shown vasorelaxant activity against nor-epinephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta strips [59]. A pronounced anticholinesterase activity of the dichloromethane extract of C. intybus roots was seen in the enzyme assay with Ellman's reagent. Two sesquiterpene lactones, namely, 8-deoxylactucin and lactucopicrin, also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of anticholinesterase [60]. The methanolic extract displays wound healing effect and β-sitosterol was determined as the active compound responsible for the activity, possibly due to its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibition [7].5. Toxicological StudiesAlthough C. intybus has a long history of human use, the high levels of secondary metabolites have shown potential toxicological effects. To evaluate the safety of the root extract of C. intybus, Ames test and subchronic toxicity assessment were conducted. The sesquiterpene-rich extract was evaluated for potential mutagenic properties (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA1535 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. Though cytotoxicity was observed at high extract doses in some strains, mutagenicity was not noted. A 28-day (subchronic) oral toxicity study, conducted in CRL:CD (SD) IGS BR rats, concluded that there was no extract-related mortality or any other signs of toxicological significance [61]. The toxicity evaluation of C. intybus extracts has also been done by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test (Microtox acute toxicity test). This bacterial test measures the decrease in light emission from the marine luminescent bacteria V. fischeri when exposed to organic extracts. The tested extracts showed less than 20% inhibition of bioluminescence and hence were concluded to be safe for human use [54].6. Clinical TrialsTwo clinical studies on chicory roots are reported in the literature, both of which are pilot studies and are therefore considered to be insufficient to support a well-established use indication for chicory root [5]. The first study, a phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating trial, was conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) [62]. In general, the treatment was well tolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highest dose of chicory had to discontinue treatment due to an adverse event. The results of the pilot study suggested that a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root has a potential role in the management of OA and merits further investigation. The second pilot study was conducted to assess whether chicory coffee consumption might confer cardiovascular benefits; thus, a clinical intervention was performed with 27 healthy volunteers, who consumed 300 mL chicory coffee daily for one week [63]. Depending on the inducer used for the aggregation test, the dietary intervention showed variable effects on platelet aggregation. Whole blood and plasma viscosity were both significantly reduced, along with serum MIF levels, after a week of chicory coffee intake. It was concluded that the full spectrum of the effects was unlikely to be attributed to a single phytochemical; nevertheless, the phenolics (including caffeic acid) are expected to play a substantial role. The study offered an encouraging starting-point to describe the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds found in chicory coffee.In the European Union, there is currently only one registered/authorized herbal medicinal product containing C. intybus as single ingredient whilst there are several combination products on the market [5]. The efficacy of herbal medicine Liv-52 consisting of Mandur bhasma, Tamarix gallica, and herbal extracts of Capparis spinosa, C. intybus, Solanum nigrum, Terminalia arjuna, and Achillea millefolium on liver cirrhosis outcomes was compared with the placebo for 6 months in 36 cirrhotic patients. The study concluded that Liv-52 possessed a hepatoprotective effect in cirrhotic patients. This protective effect of Liv-52 can be attributed to the diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulating properties of the component herbs [32].7. Cultivation and Sustainable UseGreeks and Romans began to grow chicory as a vegetable crop 4000 years ago [9]. Since the discovery in the 1970s that chicory root contains up to 40% inulin (polysaccharide), new strains have been created, with inulin content comparable to that of sugar beet [4]. It is a common vegetable in several Western European countries. It is typically grown in a biennial cycle, with a tuberised root produced during the vegetative growth phase [64]. During the first field year, the vegetative growth phase is characterized by the production of a fleshy taproot. The second field year is the generative phase in which the flowering stem is formed and seeds are produced. To produce the eatable leafy vegetable called a chicon, roots are harvested at the end of the first growing period when an appropriate stage of maturity is reached [65]. The application of inulin in the food industry was restricted to the production of coffee substitutes. It was later discovered that inulin could act as a substitute for sugar or fat due to its low caloric value. The most stable form for the commercialization of inulin is the powdered extract for its greater facility of manipulation, transport, storage, and consumption [66].Chicory is especially attractive as a cash crop since it can reach more than 62 t ha−1 under favourable conditions. Inulin content can reach on average 15% of root fresh weight and a yield of 8 t ha−1 of inulin is achievable [67]. The USA imports more than 2.3 million kilograms of chicons and 1.9 million kilograms of roasted chicory roots for coffee according to 2002 US Department of Commerce tariff and trade data [61]. Numerous studies have focused on different cultivation aspects of chicory. Chicory is considered one of the most important sources of inulin since it has a high root yield potential and also a high root sugar content [68]. A high root yield, a high inulin content, and especially long inulin chains are preferred [69]. Short chain inulin is used for the production of fructose syrup used in sweetening of cold drinks whereas long chain inulin is used as fat replacer and foam stabilizer in food products and also in the production of carboxymethyl inulin [2]. The effect of fertilizers on the growth, development, and yield of chicory has been well studied. In general, increase of nitrogen (N) increases the growth and ultimately the yield, although a high application of N has a negative effect on especially some of the amino acids. Increased N application at levels of 200 kg N ha−1 leads to a decrease in amino acids such as threonine and valine with a pronounced decreased effect on methionine. A level of 100 kg N ha−1 is preferred for enhanced quality [70]. In terms of phosphorous (P), it has been established that chicory has at least two inherent patterns of response to low or zero P conditions. One pattern is the classical increase in the length of the smallest diameter roots in response to P deficient conditions. The second pattern is a significant decrease in root tissue density under low P conditions [71]. It has also been investigated as a suitable catch crop since it has the ability to withdraw N, especially nitrate, from the soil, thereby reducing potential leaching. Additionally, it can withstand competition, has a slow juvenile development and vigorous growth after harvest of the main crop, is frost- and winter-hardy, has a well-developed root system, and does not transmit pathogens or pests to other crops [72]. Canopy closure in chicory is advantageous and critical for yield and can be achieved by a larger supply of assimilates to the shoot [73].Chicory is greatly influenced by the pH of the soil as this affects the availability of nutrients in the soil to the plant. A study conducted by Anguissola Scotti el al. [74] on two soils of pH, 5.7 and 7.0 indicated that the fly-ash or metal availability to the plant was significantly different at the different pH levels. At a low pH a decrease of Zn, Cu, Cd, and Ni was observed and for neutral soils the added metals are more available to plants than those naturally occurring in soils [75]. Chicory is a cold-requiring long-day plant [72]. In a study by Amaducci and Pritoni [68], it was shown that retarding harvest time significantly affects the content and concentration of inulin. Rainfall has proven to be another important factor since the roots contain a higher water content, thereby affecting the concentration of inulin in the roots. The same results have been obtained in a study by Baert [69] where an early sowing date and harvesting time increased the root yield, total sugar content, and inulin chain length. The increase in yield with an earlier sowing date was up to 30% higher with an increase of 10% with an earlier harvest date. The content of free fructose and sucrose increased and the content of free glucose and inulin decreased with a later harvest time [75].Even though chicory is a cold-requiring plant, cold storage after harvest can cause a strong decrease in free glucose, an increase in free fructose and sucrose, and hydrolysis of inulin [76]. This has also been observed by Ernst et al. [77] where an onset of cooler temperatures and especially colder temperatures during storage resulted in an increase in sucrose and fructose content. It was found that sucrose increased in the roots of chicory about threefold and fructose increased about tenfold within the first few weeks of cold storage after harvest [77]. The effect of storage at reduced temperature has also been studied on the levels of sesquiterpene lactones. Storage at 2°C and 10°C for up to 13 days had no effect on the level of lactucin-like sesquiterpene lactones in the chicons and after 7 days of storage a slight increase of lactucopicrin content was observed [78]. Several types of discoloration, leaf edge damage, and extensive growth of the internal core can occur in the heads of chicory during postharvest storage, which considerably reduces their market value. An atmospheric composition of 10% O2 and 10% CO2 in combination with a storage temperature of 5°C was found optimal [64]. Low temperature in the field also hastens and enhances bolting and flowering [79, 80]. The type and cultivar have been identified in numerous studies to be the determining factor during the stages of growth [81]. Suhonen [82] found the highest numbers of bolters in those being planted last, for which the mean temperatures during early growth were the highest.During the postharvest period, the major polyamines present are putrescine, especially in the oldest leaves, although spermidine is present in considerable amounts, showing a tendency to decrease with the increasing physiological age of the leaves. Free sterol content increases with postharvest and also with physiological age of the leaves. Sitosterol is the major free sterol present, followed by stigmasterol and campesterol [83].Emergence has been reported as one negative aspect of the crop, which could be addressed by specific breeding programmes [68]. Chicory can also be propagated and grown by means of micropropagation by regeneration of meristematic nodules. The leaves are cultivated in vitro and develop into plantlets when transferred to soil [84]. Although chicory can be regenerated in vitro from explants, both through organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, and from protoplasts, no transgenic plants have yet been reported that have been produced [85]. Promising potential utility technologies of the plant have emerged. Chicory roots pulps are an important by-product of the inulin processing industries and are usually used in animal feed. Other applications can be found for these materials since the extraction of chicory pulp yields high levels of pectin, a polysaccharide extensively used in food as a gelling agent, thickening agent, and stabilizer [86]. The crude protein content in chicory is more valuable than in alfalfa. Furthermore the crude lipid in chicory is generally higher than most varieties of alfalfa [9]. It also has a nutritional quality comparable to lucerne, with a mineral content superior for copper and zinc, with similar proportions of protein, lipid, minerals, and other nutrients, and palatable with good digestion with applicability in the poultry and livestock industry [87, 88].8. Conclusion
Cichorium intybus has a long tradition of use globally. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. This multipurpose plant contains high amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and mineral elements [9]. Inulin from chicory roots is considered a functional food ingredient as it affects physiological and biochemical processes resulting in better health and reduction of the risk of many diseases [89].To date, chicory remains an extremely versatile plant, amenable to genetic manipulation, and there is interest shown in genetically engineered chicory to obtain higher yields and create new potentials [1]. The documented indigenous knowledge relating to the various medicinal uses of chicory has been supported by phytochemical isolation and investigations into biological activity. Nonetheless, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential and further research is necessary to gain better understanding of the phytochemicals against various diseases [9]. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited; however, considering that the Asteraceae family is a known source of allergic problems, a contraindication for hypersensitivity should be included in the safety data [5]. Recent studies suggest the use of C. intybus as a biomonitor for heavy metals [90, 91]; considering that chicory enters the food chain, this plant should be used with caution. The apparent bioactivity of C. intybus shown in preclinical studies (both in vitro and in vivo) is a testament to its historical use in traditional medicine.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThe South African Medical Research Council, University of South Africa and the HOD, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India, are thanked for their support.References1.

Bioactive products found in Cichorium intybus


Mechanism of Action
Pharmacology:

Constituents: The active compounds in chicory are inulin, sesquiterpene lactones, vitamins, minerals, fat, mannitol and latex. Fructans have been extracted from chicory roots.10 
The postulated biosynthesis of sesquiterpene lactones through the mevalonate-farnesyl diphosphate-germacradiene pathway has been confirmed by the isolation of a (+)-germacrene A synthase from chicory roots.11 
Chemical constituents of Cichorium intybus L. were identified as alpha-amyrin, taraxerone, baurenyl acetate and beta-sitosterol.12 Inulooligosaccharides (IOS) production from chicory extract was carried out using endoinulinase obtained from a new isolate, Xanthomonas oryzae No. 5.13 Twelve compounds were isolated from the root of Cichorium intybus including 2, 3, 4, 9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido-(3,4-b)indole-3-carboxylic acid.14 
Antiallergic effects: Cichorium intybus inhibits mast cell-mediated immediate-type allergic reactions in vivo and in vitro.15 
Antihyperlipidemic effects: Inulin decreases serum triglycerides by decreasing fatty acid synthesis and reducing production of low density lipoproteins (VLDL).7 
Anti-inflammatory effects: Chicory has been found to inhibit prostaglandin E(2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2).1 
Antineoplastic effects: Chicory derived beta (2-1) fructans have been shown to exert cancer protective effects in animal models.16,3 
Chicory fructan supplements inhibit aberrant crypt foci formation, an early preneoplastic marker of malignant potential in the process of colon Carcinogenesis.17 
Calcium homeostasis activity: The leaves of chicory maintain calcium levels by heterologous expression of total RNA.2,5,18 
Cytochrome P450 activity: Chicory is known to contain guaianolides, eudesmanolides, and germacranolides. The biosynthesis of these sesquiterpene lactones are involved with the cytochrome P450 enzyme.9,19 
Fecal bulking properties: Inulin and oligofructose are considered dietary fibers. They share the basic common characteristics of dietary fibers including saccharides of plant origin, resistance to digestion and absorption in the small intestine, and fermentation in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids that are absorbed and metabolized in various parts of the body. Moreover, this fermentation induced by difidobacteria has a bulking effect.20 Fermentation of inulin decreases fecal pH and increases fecal volume.8 
Hypoglycemic effect: One animal study concluded dietary inulin-type fructans extracted from chicory root may modulate the production of peptides, such as incretins, by endocrine cells present in the intestinal mucosa. This effect may play a role in the management of obesity and diabetes through their capacity to promote secretion of endogenous gastrointestinal peptides involved in appetite regulation.4 
Immunostimulatory activity: Oligofructose and inulin, selective fermentable chicory fructans, have been shown to stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria, which are regarded as beneficial strains in the colon.21,22,23 
Chicory and mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) alter fecal microbial populations and certain indices of the immune system.24 
Mutagenic properties: Chicory powder has shown very weak mutagenic activity of commonly consumed food dishes in South India.25 
Prebiotic effect: One clinical trial assessed the prebiotic effect of an Fn-type chicory inulin hydrolysate product.6 The F is for fructose and the n is the number of b(2->1) bound fructose moieties. Eight subjects (5 females and 3 males) consumed 8g daily of an Fn-rich chicory inulin product for up to 5 weeks. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed for total anaerobes, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, bacteroides, coliforms and Clostridium perfringens. Both 2 and 5-week of oligofructose feeding resulted in a selective increase in bifidobacteria (p< 0.01). A daily intake of 8g of Fn-type oligofructose preparation reduced fecal pH and caused little intestinal discomfort.

Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[4] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae. It usually has bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink.[5]
It is often used as a food plant, and often as a coffee substitute. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots. The roots of variety sativum are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. 
In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fibre.[6]
Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock.[7] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely introduced.[8][9][10]
"Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia). These two closely related species are often confused.[11]

Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[4] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber.[5]
Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock.[6] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely naturalized.[7][8][9] "Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia); these two closely related species are often confused.[10]

Names[edit]
Common chicory is also known as blue daisy, blue dandelion, blue sailors, blue weed, bunk, coffeeweed, cornflower, hendibeh, horseweed, ragged sailors, succory, wild bachelor's buttons, and wild endive.[11] (Note: "Cornflower" is commonly applied to Centaurea cyanus.)  Common names for varieties of var. foliosum include endive, radicchio, radichetta, Belgian endive, French endive, red endive, sugarloaf, and witloof (or witlof).

Description[edit]
When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem, from 30 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) tall.  The leaves are stalked, lanceolate and unlobed.  The flower heads are 2 to 4 cm (​1⁄4 to ​1 1⁄2 inches) wide, and usually light purple or lavender (see picture) and it has been described as light blue, rarely white or pink.  Of the two rows of involucral bracts, the inner is longer and erect, the outer is shorter and spreading. It flowers from July until October.  The achenes have no pappus (feathery hairs), but do have toothed scales on top.[12]

Culinary uses[edit]
Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been cultivated in Europe as a coffee substitute.[13] The roots are baked, roasted, ground, and used as an additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and southern United States, particularly in New Orleans. In France a mixture of 60% chicory and 40% coffee is sold as Ricoré. It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and during World War II in Continental Europe. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye, was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "East German coffee crisis" of 1976–79. It is also added to coffee in Spanish,  Greek, Turkish, Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian cuisines.[14]
Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to stouts (commonly expected to have a coffee-like flavour). Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.

Leaf chicory[edit]
Wild[edit]
Wild chicory leaves usually have a bitter taste. Their bitterness is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the Ligurian and Apulian regions of Italy and also in the southern part of India.  In Ligurian cuisine,  wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of preboggion and in Greek cuisine of horta; in the Apulian region, wild chicory leaves are combined with fava bean puree in the traditional local dish fave e cicorie selvatiche.[15] In Albania, the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of byrek.
By cooking and discarding the water, the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be sautéed with garlic, anchovies, and other ingredients. In this form, the resulting greens might be combined with pasta[16] or accompany meat dishes.[17]

Cultivated[edit]
Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as salad leaves. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:[18]

Radicchio usually has variegated red or red and green leaves. Some only refer to the white-veined red-leaved type as radicchio, also known as red endive and red chicory. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted. It can also be used to add color and zest to salads. It is largely used in Italy in different varieties, the most famous being the ones from Treviso (known as radicchio rosso di Treviso),[19][20] from Verona (radicchio di Verona), and Chioggia (radicchio di Chioggia), which are classified as an IGP.[21] It is also common in Greece.[citation needed]
Sugarloaf looks rather like cos lettuce, with tightly packed leaves.[22]
 Witloof, Belgian endive
Belgian endive is known in Dutch as witloof or witlof ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States,[23] indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of northern France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors in the absence of sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves.  It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour.  The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem at the bottom of the head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness.  Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium.[24] Today France is the largest producer of endive.[25]
Catalogna chicory (Cichorium intybus var. foliosum), also known as puntarelle, includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from radicchio)[26] of chicory and is used throughout Italy.
 Leaves unlobed and pointed
 Inflorescences of a blue-flowered form, note the two rows of bracts
Although leaf chicory is often called "endive", true endive (Cichorium endivia) is a different species in the genus, distinct from Belgian endive.

Chicory root and inulin[edit]
Around 1970, it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin, a polysaccharide similar to starch. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon, etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power 10% that of sucrose[27] and is sometimes added to yogurts as a prebiotic. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble dietary fiber and functional food.[28]
Chicory root extract is a dietary supplement or food additive produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the insoluble fraction by filtration and centrifugation.   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of soluble fiber.  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% inulin, 14% sucrose, 5% cellulose, 6% protein, 4% ash, and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, about 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.[29]
Fresh chicory root may contain between 13 and 23% inulin, by total weight.[30]

Agents responsible for bitterness[edit]
The bitter substances are primarily the two sesquiterpene lactones, lactucin and lactucopicrin. Other ingredients are aesculetin, aesculin, cichoriin, umbelliferone, scopoletin, 6,7-dihydrocoumarin, and further sesquiterpene lactones and their glycosides.[31]

Chicory root contains essential oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus Tanacetum.[32]
In traditional medicine, chicory has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies.[33] According to Cancer Research UK, "essence therapists believe that using essences can help to increase your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing ... Essences are not used to prevent, control, or cure cancer or any other physical condition."[34]

Forage[edit]
Chicory is highly digestible for ruminants and has a low fiber concentration.[35] Chicory roots are an "excellent substitute for oats" for horses due to their protein and fat content.[36] Chicory contains a low quantity of reduced tannins[35] that may increase protein utilization efficiency in ruminants.
Some tannins reduce intestinal parasites.[37][38] Dietary chicory may be toxic to internal parasites, with studies of ingesting chicory by farm animals having lower worm burdens, leading to its use as a forage supplement.[39][40][41] Although chicory might have originated in France, Italy, and India,[42] much development of chicory for use with livestock has taken place in New Zealand.[43]

Forage chicory varieties[edit]

Puna (Grasslands Puna)
Developed in New Zealand, Grasslands Puna is well adapted to different climates, being grown from Alberta, Canada, to New Mexico and Florida. It is resistant to bolting, which leads to high nutrient levels in the leaves in spring. It also has high resistance to grazing.
Forage Feast
A variety from France used for human consumption and also for wildlife plots, where animals such as deer might graze. It is very cold-hardy, and being lower in tannins than other forage varieties, is suitable for human consumption.
Choice
Choice has been bred for high winter and early-spring growth activity, and lower amounts of lactucin and lactone, which are believed to taint milk. It is also use for seeding deer wildlife plots.
Oasis
Oasis was bred for increased lactone rates for the forage industry, and for higher resistance to fungal diseases such as Sclerotinia.[clarification needed]
Puna II
This variety is more winter-active than most others, which leads to greater persistence and longevity.
Grouse
A New Zealand variety, it is  used as a planting companion for forage brassicas. More prone to early flowering than other varieties, it has higher crowns more susceptible to overbrowsing.
Six Point
A United States variety, it is very similar to Puna.
History[edit]
The chicory plant is one of the earliest cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance").[44] In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importation of coffee into Prussia, leading to the development of a coffee substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Förster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795, 22 to 24 factories of this type were in Brunswick.[45][46] Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779[47] as the "chicoree", which the French cultivated as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France, chicory frequently appeared as an adulterant in coffee, or as a coffee substitute.[48] Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, has been on sale since 1885.
The cultivated chicory plant has a history reaching back to ancient Egyptian time.[citation needed] Medieval monks raised the plants and when coffee was introduced to Europe, the Dutch thought that chicory made a lively addition to the bean drink.
In the United States, chicory root has long been used as a substitute for coffee in prisons.[49] By the 1840s, the port of New Orleans was the second-largest importer of coffee (after New York).[48] Louisianans began to add chicory root to their coffee when Union naval blockades during the American Civil War cut off the port of New Orleans, thereby creating a long-standing tradition.[48]
A common meal in Rome, puntarelle, is made with chicory sprouts.[50] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports that chicory is a native plant of western Asia, North Africa, and Europe.[4]
Chicory is also mentioned in certain silk-growing texts. The primary caretaker of the silkworms, the "silkworm mother", should not eat or even touch it.[citation needed]
The chicory flower is often seen as inspiration for the Romantic concept of the Blue Flower (e.g. in German language Blauwarte ≈ blue lookout by the wayside). It could open locked doors, according to European folklore.[51]

Cichorium intybus, commonly known as chicory, is well known as a coffee substitute but is also widely used medicinally to treat various ailments ranging from wounds to diabetes. Although this plant has a rich history of use in folklore, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.1. IntroductionThe genus Cichorium (Asteraceae) consists of six species with major distribution areas in Europe and Asia [1]. In several Asteraceae, inulin, a β-2,1 linked fructose polymer with a terminal glucose residue, functions as a reserve carbohydrate in stems, tubers, and taproots [2]. Cichorium intybus L., commonly known as chicory, is an erect fairly woody perennial herb, around 1 m in height with a fleshy taproot of up to 75 cm in length and large basal leaves [1, 3]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the root of C. intybus contained up to 40% inulin, which has a negligible impact on blood sugar and thus is suitable for diabetics [4]. To date, C. intybus is grown for the production of inulin on an industrial scale [2]. The name of the plant is derived from Greek and Latin. Cichorium means field and intybus is partly derived from the Greek “to cut”, because of the leaves, and partly from the Latin tubus to indicate the hollow stem [5].Chicory is a hardy plant and can endure extreme temperatures during both vegetative and reproductive growth stages [1]. When broken, all plant parts exudate a milky latex [3]. Cichorium intybus is cultivated for numerous applications and can be divided into four main varieties or cultigroups according to their use [6]: (1) “industrial” or “root” chicory, predominantly cultivated in northwestern Europe, India, South Africa, and Chile, produces the taproot as a coffee substitute or for inulin extraction; (2) “Brussels” or “witloof” chicory is commonly cultivated around Europe as industrial chicory for etiolated buds (chicons) by forcing; (3) “leaf” chicory is used as fresh or cooked vegetables; and (4) “forage” chicory, initially derived from wild chicory commonly found along roadsides and waste areas, has been used since the mid-1970s to intensify herbage obtainability in perennial pastures for livestock.
Cichorium intybus is a medicinally important plant in Eurasia and in parts of Africa. Despite its long tradition of use, the plant is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in any official Pharmacopoeia of a European Union member state [5]. However, due to its prevalent distribution, different parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicines globally [7]. Important phytochemicals are distributed throughout the plant, but the main contents are present in the root [1]. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.2. Traditional UsesMedicinal plants have been used for centuries and numerous cultures still rely on indigenous medicinal plants to meet their primary health care needs. It is likely that the insightful knowledge of plant-based remedies in traditional cultures advanced through trial and error and that the most important cures were carefully passed from one generation to another [8]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant [9] and it has had a long history of therapeutic use both in areas where it is indigenous and in areas where it has been introduced. The various common or local names describing this plant may be ascribed to the widespread use by different folkloric groups. Different preparations of this plant are employed to treat various symptoms and ailments (Table 1). The juice is said to be a folk remedy for cancer of the uterus and for tumors [4]. In South Africa, although it is considered a widespread weed, leaves, stems, and roots are made into a tea for jaundice and chicory syrup is used as a tonic and purifying medicine for infants [3]. In Turkey, an ointment is made from the leaves for wound healing [10]. Decoction refers to a preparation that is made by adding cold water to the plant material which is then boiled and allowed to simmer for 5–10 min after which it is strained [8]. Chicory decoctions are traditionally made from individual plant parts and/or from the plant as a whole (Table 1).Table 1Traditional medicinal uses of Cichorium intybus.CountryTraditional use(s)Plant part(s)Preparation(s)ReferenceAfghanistanMalariaRootAqueous extract[12]

Prior to the wars in Afghanistan, folkloric reports described the use of aqueous root extracts as a light-sensitive plant remedy for malaria. This indigenous knowledge has since been confirmed and the antimalarial compounds of C. intybus roots have been identified as the light-sensitive sesquiterpene lactones lactucin and lactucopicrin [12]. The flowers of the chicory plant (Cichorii flos) are used as a herbal treatment of everyday ailments such as a tonic and appetite stimulant and as a treatment of gallstones, gastroenteritis, sinus problems, cuts, and bruises [4]. In Italy, the whorls are made into a decoction and used as a depurative [13]. Chicory seeds are one of the main ingredients of Jigrine, a commercial product of India used for the treatment of various diseases of the liver [14]. Other plant parts are also used for liver disorders, namely, aerial parts in Bosnia and Herzegovina [15] and roots in Serbia and India [16, 17].3. Chemical ConstituentsChicoric acid has been identified as the major compound in methanolic extracts of chicory (Table 2) [18]. Aliphatic compounds and their derivatives comprise the main fraction while terpenoids comprise minor constituents of the plant. The flowers of chicory contain saccharides, methoxycoumarin cichorine, flavonoids, essential oils [4], and anthocyanins contributing to the blue colour of the perianth [19]. Table 2 provides a summary of the compounds isolated and identified from chicory. Octane, n-nonadecane, pentadecanone, hexadecane, and a tentatively identified compound have been found as principal volatile components [4]. A list of volatile compounds is given in Table 3.Table 2Compounds isolated and identified from Cichorium intybus (chicory).CompoundReference(s)Lactucin [12, 31, 103] Lactucopicrin[12, 31]8-Deoxylactucin[31, 104]Jacquilenin[103]11β,13-Dihydrolactucin[103]11,13-Dihydrolactucopicrin[103, 104]Crepidiaside B [103]Cyanidin 3-O-p-(6-O-malonyl)-D-glucopyranoside[105]3,4β-Dihydro-15-dehydrolactucopicrin[103]Magnolialide[103]Ixerisoside D[103]Loliolide[103]Cichorioside B[103, 104]Sonchuside A[103, 104]Artesin [103]Cichoriolide[103]Cichorioside[103]Sonchuside C [103]Cichopumilide[103]Putrescine[83]Spermidine[83]

Cichorium intybus presents a little investigated plant in terms of phytochemistry and pharmacology. Over 100 individual compounds have been isolated and identified from this plant (Table 2), the majority of which are from the roots. Most of the pharmacological studies on this plant document the testing of aqueous and/or alcoholic extracts only. Apart from the pharmacologically important activities, the use of C. intybus (hairy root cultures) has also been implicated in the phytoremediation of DDT [20].4.1. Antimicrobial ActivityThe antibacterial activity of the organic acid-rich extract of fresh red chicory (C. intybus var. sylvestre) was tested against periodontopathic bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Prevotella intermedia. The compounds identified from the active extract include oxalic acid, succinic acid, quinic acid, and shikimic acid. All of the organic acids were found to decrease biofilm formation and adhesion of bacteria to the cells, with different levels of efficacy. These compounds also induced biofilm disruption and detachment of dead cells for the cultured substratum [21]. In other reports on the antimicrobial activity of C. intybus, the crude aqueous and organic seed extracts were found to be active against four pathogenic microorganisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, and root extracts had pronounced effects on Bacillus subtilis, S. aureus, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and E. coli [22, 23]. The leaf extract of C. intybus also showed a moderate activity against multidrug resistant S. typhi [24]. Guaianolides-rich root extracts of C. intybus have shown antifungal properties against anthropophilic fungi Trichophyton tonsurans, T. rubrum, and T. violaceum [25]. A sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin cichoralexin isolated from chicory exhibited potent antifungal activity against Pseudomonas cichorii [26].4.2. Anthelmintic ActivitySeveral studies have been conducted on grazing animals to determine the anthelmintic potential of secondary metabolites present in C. intybus. Grossly, it has been concluded that the animals grazing on chicory have a higher performance index and lower incidence of gastrointestinal nematode infestations. In the majority of the experiments, the condensed tannins and sesquiterpene lactones were responsible for anthelmintic activity [27]. Anthelmintic activity of chicory has also been noticed in the case of lambs wherein the total number of abomasal helminths was found to be lesser in the lambs grazing on this plant [28]. The condensed tannin and sesquiterpene-rich extracts of C. intybus were evaluated for their efficacy against the larvae of deer lungworm, Dictyocaulus viviparous and other gastrointestinal nematode larvae using a larval migration inhibition assay. A dose-dependent decrease in the larval motility was observed in both lungworm and gastrointestinal nematodes [29]. The sesquiterpene lactone-rich extracts of C. intybus were also found to inhibit egg hatching of Haemonchus contortus [30].4.3. Antimalarial ActivityThe infusion of fresh roots of C. intybus has a history of use as a remedy for malarial fevers in some parts of Afghanistan. The bitter compounds in the plant, namely, lactucin, lactucopicrin, and the guaianolide sesquiterpenes, isolated from aqueous root extracts of chicory were concluded to be the antimalarial components of the plant. Lactucin and lactucopicrin completely inhibited the HB3 clone of strain Honduras-1 of Plasmodium falciparum at concentrations of 10 and 50 μg/mL, respectively [12, 31].4.4. Hepatoprotective ActivityThe folkloric use of C. intybus as a hepatoprotectant has been well documented. It is one of the herbal components of Liv-52, a traditional Indian tonic used widely for hepatoprotection. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted on cirrhotic patients, Liv-52 medication reduced the serum levels of hepatic enzymes, namely, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. It also reduced the Child-Pugh scores and ascites significantly [32]. Another polyherbal formulation, Jigrine, contains the leaves of C. intybus as one of its 14 constituents. Jigrine was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activity against galactosamine-induced hepatopathy in rats. The pretreatment of male Wistar-albino rats with jigrine significantly reduced the levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and urea and increased the levels of blood and tissue glutathione. Histopathological examination of the liver revealed that jigrine pretreatment prevented galactosamine toxicity and caused a marked decrease in inflamed cells [33].The aqueous-methanolic extract of the seeds of C. intybus has been investigated for the hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in mice. It was found to decrease both the death rate and the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamyl pyruvate transaminase [34]. In analogous studies, the antihepatotoxic activity of the alcoholic extract of the seeds and aqueous extracts of the roots and root callus of C. intybus was estimated. The oral administration of these extracts in albino rats led to a marked decrease in the levels of hepatic enzymes. Also, histopathological examination of the liver showed no fat accumulation or necrosis after the treatment [14, 35]. Similar studies have established the hepatoprotective effect of esculetin, a phenolic compound, and cichotyboside, a guaianolide sesquiterpene glycoside reported from C. intybus [36, 37].The carbon tetrachloride and paracetamol-induced liver toxicities were also found to be counteracted by intraperitoneal administration of crude extracts and fractions of C. intybus. The methanol- and water-soluble fractions exhibited marked reductions in serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. In the same study, toxicity was induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with galactosamine and thioacetamide [38].The phenolic acid-rich seed extract of C. intybus was evaluated for its efficacy against hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro model of hepatic steatosis was created by incubation of the HepG2 cells with oleic acid leading to intracellular accumulation of fat. The seed extract was effective in decreasing the deposited fat from the cells in case of administration after the initial fat deposition (i.e., nonsimultaneous administration with oleic acid). However, in case of simultaneous administration of seed extract and oleic acid, the extract could not protect the cells from steatosis except at very high doses. The extract also led to the increased release of glycerol (an indicator of triglyceride degradation) in steatotic cells. In case of nonsimultaneous administration, the extract was found to upregulate the expression of SREBP-1c and PPAR-α genes leading to restoration of normal levels of corresponding proteins. In the in vivo model of hepatic steatosis, namely, diabetic rats, treatment with seed extract resulted in significant decrease in fat accumulation and fibrosis [39].The hepatoprotective activity of C. intybus has been correlated to its ability to inhibit the free radical mediated damage. A fraction prepared from the ethanolic extract of the leaves was assessed for preventive action on the free radical mediated damage to the deoxyribose sugar of the DNA (obtained from calf thymus). A dose-dependent decrease in the DNA damage was observed in the present assay [40].4.5. Antidiabetic ActivityChicory has reported antidiabetic activity [17, 41]. Based on the traditional use of C. intybus in diabetes mellitus, the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of the ethanol extract of the whole plant were investigated. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ethanol extract, at a dose of 125 mg/Kg body weight, significantly attenuated the serum glucose levels in the oral glucose tolerance test. A marked decrease in the serum triglycerides and cholesterol was also observed in the extract-treated rats. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found to be reduced in extract-treated diabetic rats as compared to untreated diabetic rats [17]. The antidiabetic effect of the aqueous seed extract of C. intybus has also been investigated. Early-stage and late-stage diabetes were differently induced in male Wistar albino rats by streptozotocin-niacinamide and streptozotocin alone, respectively. The treatment with chicory extract prevented weight loss in both early-stage and late-stage diabetic rats. Chicory-treated diabetic animals resisted excessive increase in fasting blood sugar (assessed by glucose tolerance test). Grossly, normalization of blood parameters, namely, alanine aminotransferase, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and glycosylated heamoglobin, was seen in these animals. In early-stage diabetic rats, chicory treatment led to the increase in insulin levels pointing toward the insulin-sensitizing action of chicory [42].Feeding the diabetic Wistar rats with C. intybus leaf powder led to a decrease in blood glucose levels to near normal value. C. intybus administration also decreased the malondialdehyde (formed by thiobarbituric acid) levels and increased glutathione content. Anticholinesterase activity was restored to near normal, brain lipopolysaccharide decreased, and catalase activity increased [43]. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid have been described as potential antidiabetic agents by increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells. Both compounds were also able to stimulate insulin secretion from an insulin-secreting cell line and islets of Langerhans. Another compound, chicoric acid, is also a new potential antidiabetic agent exhibiting both insulin-sensitizing and insulin-secreting properties [44].4.6. Gastroprotective Activity
C. intybus has been used in Turkish folklore for its antiulcerogenic potency. The aqueous decoction of C. intybus roots was orally administered to Sprague-Dawley rats 15 minutes before the induction of ulcerogenesis by ethanol. More than 95% inhibition of ulcerogenesis was observed in the test group [45].4.7. Anti-Inflammatory ActivityThe inhibition of TNF-α mediated cyclooxygenase (COX) induction by chicory root extracts was investigated in the human colon carcinoma (HT 29) cell line. The ethyl acetate extract inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-α mediated induction of COX-2 expression was also suppressed by the chicory extract [46].4.8. Analgesic ActivityLactucin, lactucopicrin, and 11β, 13-dihydrolactucin exhibited analgesic action in mice in hot plate and tail-flick tests. In the hot plate test, all three compounds exerted an analgesic effect, with lactucopicrin being the most potent compound. In the tail-flick test, the antinociceptive effects of all the tested compounds (30 mg/kg dose) were comparable to that of ibuprofen (60 mg/kg dose). Lactucin and lactucopicrin were also established to have some sedative action as evident from the decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in mice [47].4.9. Antioxidant ActivityThe DPPH radical scavenging activity of a polyphenols-rich fraction of C. intybus has been investigated [48]. The anti- and prooxidant activities of Cichorium species were studied in chemical as well as biological systems. In the case of chemical systems, the antioxidant activity of water-soluble compounds in C. intybus var. silvestre was established in the coupled model of linoleic acid and β-carotene. A pro-oxidant activity of some of the chemical components was recorded initially which notably diminished with time and/or thermal treatment. Thereafter, the antioxidant activity of the raw juice and its fractions persisted. The molecular weight ranges of the antioxidant fractions of raw juice were also identified based on dialysis [49]. Two varieties of chicory, namely, C. intybus var. silvestre and C. intybus var. foliosum, have been investigated for their antioxidant (antiradical) activities in two distinct biological systems. The lipid peroxidation assay has been carried out on microsome membranes of rat hepatocytes after the induction of oxidative damage by carbon tetrachloride. The antiradical activity was expressed as the protective activity against lipid peroxidation and calculated as the percentage decrease in hydroperoxide degradation products. The second biological system used was the cultures of S. aureus after treatment with cumene hydroperoxide. The percentage increase of growth of bacteria was noted after the treatment with juices of chicory varieties. In both systems, the juices of chicory varieties showed strong antiradical activities [21, 49].Red chicory (C. intybus var. silvestre) was studied for its polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by using the synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical and three model reactions catalyzed by pertinent enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species, namely, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and diaphorase. Total phenolics were significantly correlated with the antioxidant activity evaluated with both the synthetic radical and the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. On a molar basis, red chicory phenolics were as efficient as Trolox (reference compound) in scavenging the synthetic radical [50]. The aqueous-alcoholic extracts of the aerial parts of C. intybus also inhibited xanthine oxidase enzyme dose dependently [51]. In another study, along with DPPH radical scavenging activity, C. intybus also exhibited inhibition of hydrogen peroxide and chelation of ferrous ion [52].4.10. Tumor-Inhibitory ActivityThe crude ethanolic extract of C. intybus roots caused a significant inhibition of Ehrlich tumor carcinoma in mice. A 70% increase in the life span was observed with a 500 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal dose of the tested extract [53]. The aqueous-alcoholic macerate of the leaves of C. intybus also exerted an antiproliferative effect on amelanotic melanoma C32 cell lines [54]. Magnolialide, a 1β-hydroxyeudesmanolide isolated from the roots of C. intybus, inhibited several tumor cell lines and induced the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells to monocyte or macrophage-like cells [55].4.11. Antiallergic ActivityThe aqueous extract of C. intybus inhibited the mast cell-mediated immediate allergic reactions in vitro as well as in vivo. This extract restrained the systemic anaphylactic reaction in mice in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction caused by anti-dinitrophenyl IgE in rats. Other markers of allergic reaction, namely, plasma histamine levels and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, decreased significantly whereas the levels of cAMP increased after the treatment with C. intybus extract [56].4.12. Other Pharmacologically Important ActivitiesThe ethanol extract of the roots of C. intybus is reported to prevent the immunotoxic effects of ethanol in ICR mice. It was noted that body weight gains were markedly decreased in mice administered with ethanol. However, the body weight was not affected when ethanol was coadministered with the ethanol extract of C. intybus. Similarly, the weights of liver and spleen were not affected when ethanol extract was given along with ethanol. A considerable restoration in the other markers of immunity, namely, hemagglutination titer, plaque forming cells of spleen, secondary IgG antibody production, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (in response to subcutaneous administration of sheep red-blood cells to paw), phagocytic activity, number of circulating leucocytes, NK cell activity, cell proliferation, and production of interferon-γ, was registered [57]. The immunoactive potential of an aqueous-alcoholic extract of the roots was established by a mitogen proliferation assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The extract showed an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of phytohemagglutinin and a stimulatory effect on MLR [58].Chicoric acid has shown vasorelaxant activity against nor-epinephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta strips [59]. A pronounced anticholinesterase activity of the dichloromethane extract of C. intybus roots was seen in the enzyme assay with Ellman's reagent. Two sesquiterpene lactones, namely, 8-deoxylactucin and lactucopicrin, also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of anticholinesterase [60]. The methanolic extract displays wound healing effect and β-sitosterol was determined as the active compound responsible for the activity, possibly due to its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibition [7].5. Toxicological StudiesAlthough C. intybus has a long history of human use, the high levels of secondary metabolites have shown potential toxicological effects. To evaluate the safety of the root extract of C. intybus, Ames test and subchronic toxicity assessment were conducted. The sesquiterpene-rich extract was evaluated for potential mutagenic properties (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA1535 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. Though cytotoxicity was observed at high extract doses in some strains, mutagenicity was not noted. A 28-day (subchronic) oral toxicity study, conducted in CRL:CD (SD) IGS BR rats, concluded that there was no extract-related mortality or any other signs of toxicological significance [61]. The toxicity evaluation of C. intybus extracts has also been done by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test (Microtox acute toxicity test). This bacterial test measures the decrease in light emission from the marine luminescent bacteria V. fischeri when exposed to organic extracts. The tested extracts showed less than 20% inhibition of bioluminescence and hence were concluded to be safe for human use [54].6. Clinical TrialsTwo clinical studies on chicory roots are reported in the literature, both of which are pilot studies and are therefore considered to be insufficient to support a well-established use indication for chicory root [5]. The first study, a phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating trial, was conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) [62]. In general, the treatment was well tolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highest dose of chicory had to discontinue treatment due to an adverse event. The results of the pilot study suggested that a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root has a potential role in the management of OA and merits further investigation. The second pilot study was conducted to assess whether chicory coffee consumption might confer cardiovascular benefits; thus, a clinical intervention was performed with 27 healthy volunteers, who consumed 300 mL chicory coffee daily for one week [63]. Depending on the inducer used for the aggregation test, the dietary intervention showed variable effects on platelet aggregation. Whole blood and plasma viscosity were both significantly reduced, along with serum MIF levels, after a week of chicory coffee intake. It was concluded that the full spectrum of the effects was unlikely to be attributed to a single phytochemical; nevertheless, the phenolics (including caffeic acid) are expected to play a substantial role. The study offered an encouraging starting-point to describe the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds found in chicory coffee.In the European Union, there is currently only one registered/authorized herbal medicinal product containing C. intybus as single ingredient whilst there are several combination products on the market [5]. The efficacy of herbal medicine Liv-52 consisting of Mandur bhasma, Tamarix gallica, and herbal extracts of Capparis spinosa, C. intybus, Solanum nigrum, Terminalia arjuna, and Achillea millefolium on liver cirrhosis outcomes was compared with the placebo for 6 months in 36 cirrhotic patients. The study concluded that Liv-52 possessed a hepatoprotective effect in cirrhotic patients. This protective effect of Liv-52 can be attributed to the diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulating properties of the component herbs [32].7. Cultivation and Sustainable UseGreeks and Romans began to grow chicory as a vegetable crop 4000 years ago [9]. Since the discovery in the 1970s that chicory root contains up to 40% inulin (polysaccharide), new strains have been created, with inulin content comparable to that of sugar beet [4]. It is a common vegetable in several Western European countries. It is typically grown in a biennial cycle, with a tuberised root produced during the vegetative growth phase [64]. During the first field year, the vegetative growth phase is characterized by the production of a fleshy taproot. The second field year is the generative phase in which the flowering stem is formed and seeds are produced. To produce the eatable leafy vegetable called a chicon, roots are harvested at the end of the first growing period when an appropriate stage of maturity is reached [65]. The application of inulin in the food industry was restricted to the production of coffee substitutes. It was later discovered that inulin could act as a substitute for sugar or fat due to its low caloric value. The most stable form for the commercialization of inulin is the powdered extract for its greater facility of manipulation, transport, storage, and consumption [66].Chicory is especially attractive as a cash crop since it can reach more than 62 t ha−1 under favourable conditions. Inulin content can reach on average 15% of root fresh weight and a yield of 8 t ha−1 of inulin is achievable [67]. The USA imports more than 2.3 million kilograms of chicons and 1.9 million kilograms of roasted chicory roots for coffee according to 2002 US Department of Commerce tariff and trade data [61]. Numerous studies have focused on different cultivation aspects of chicory. Chicory is considered one of the most important sources of inulin since it has a high root yield potential and also a high root sugar content [68]. A high root yield, a high inulin content, and especially long inulin chains are preferred [69]. Short chain inulin is used for the production of fructose syrup used in sweetening of cold drinks whereas long chain inulin is used as fat replacer and foam stabilizer in food products and also in the production of carboxymethyl inulin [2]. The effect of fertilizers on the growth, development, and yield of chicory has been well studied. In general, increase of nitrogen (N) increases the growth and ultimately the yield, although a high application of N has a negative effect on especially some of the amino acids. Increased N application at levels of 200 kg N ha−1 leads to a decrease in amino acids such as threonine and valine with a pronounced decreased effect on methionine. A level of 100 kg N ha−1 is preferred for enhanced quality [70]. In terms of phosphorous (P), it has been established that chicory has at least two inherent patterns of response to low or zero P conditions. One pattern is the classical increase in the length of the smallest diameter roots in response to P deficient conditions. The second pattern is a significant decrease in root tissue density under low P conditions [71]. It has also been investigated as a suitable catch crop since it has the ability to withdraw N, especially nitrate, from the soil, thereby reducing potential leaching. Additionally, it can withstand competition, has a slow juvenile development and vigorous growth after harvest of the main crop, is frost- and winter-hardy, has a well-developed root system, and does not transmit pathogens or pests to other crops [72]. Canopy closure in chicory is advantageous and critical for yield and can be achieved by a larger supply of assimilates to the shoot [73].Chicory is greatly influenced by the pH of the soil as this affects the availability of nutrients in the soil to the plant. A study conducted by Anguissola Scotti el al. [74] on two soils of pH, 5.7 and 7.0 indicated that the fly-ash or metal availability to the plant was significantly different at the different pH levels. At a low pH a decrease of Zn, Cu, Cd, and Ni was observed and for neutral soils the added metals are more available to plants than those naturally occurring in soils [75]. Chicory is a cold-requiring long-day plant [72]. In a study by Amaducci and Pritoni [68], it was shown that retarding harvest time significantly affects the content and concentration of inulin. Rainfall has proven to be another important factor since the roots contain a higher water content, thereby affecting the concentration of inulin in the roots. The same results have been obtained in a study by Baert [69] where an early sowing date and harvesting time increased the root yield, total sugar content, and inulin chain length. The increase in yield with an earlier sowing date was up to 30% higher with an increase of 10% with an earlier harvest date. The content of free fructose and sucrose increased and the content of free glucose and inulin decreased with a later harvest time [75].Even though chicory is a cold-requiring plant, cold storage after harvest can cause a strong decrease in free glucose, an increase in free fructose and sucrose, and hydrolysis of inulin [76]. This has also been observed by Ernst et al. [77] where an onset of cooler temperatures and especially colder temperatures during storage resulted in an increase in sucrose and fructose content. It was found that sucrose increased in the roots of chicory about threefold and fructose increased about tenfold within the first few weeks of cold storage after harvest [77]. The effect of storage at reduced temperature has also been studied on the levels of sesquiterpene lactones. Storage at 2°C and 10°C for up to 13 days had no effect on the level of lactucin-like sesquiterpene lactones in the chicons and after 7 days of storage a slight increase of lactucopicrin content was observed [78]. Several types of discoloration, leaf edge damage, and extensive growth of the internal core can occur in the heads of chicory during postharvest storage, which considerably reduces their market value. An atmospheric composition of 10% O2 and 10% CO2 in combination with a storage temperature of 5°C was found optimal [64]. Low temperature in the field also hastens and enhances bolting and flowering [79, 80]. The type and cultivar have been identified in numerous studies to be the determining factor during the stages of growth [81]. Suhonen [82] found the highest numbers of bolters in those being planted last, for which the mean temperatures during early growth were the highest.During the postharvest period, the major polyamines present are putrescine, especially in the oldest leaves, although spermidine is present in considerable amounts, showing a tendency to decrease with the increasing physiological age of the leaves. Free sterol content increases with postharvest and also with physiological age of the leaves. Sitosterol is the major free sterol present, followed by stigmasterol and campesterol [83].Emergence has been reported as one negative aspect of the crop, which could be addressed by specific breeding programmes [68]. Chicory can also be propagated and grown by means of micropropagation by regeneration of meristematic nodules. The leaves are cultivated in vitro and develop into plantlets when transferred to soil [84]. Although chicory can be regenerated in vitro from explants, both through organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, and from protoplasts, no transgenic plants have yet been reported that have been produced [85]. Promising potential utility technologies of the plant have emerged. Chicory roots pulps are an important by-product of the inulin processing industries and are usually used in animal feed. Other applications can be found for these materials since the extraction of chicory pulp yields high levels of pectin, a polysaccharide extensively used in food as a gelling agent, thickening agent, and stabilizer [86]. The crude protein content in chicory is more valuable than in alfalfa. Furthermore the crude lipid in chicory is generally higher than most varieties of alfalfa [9]. It also has a nutritional quality comparable to lucerne, with a mineral content superior for copper and zinc, with similar proportions of protein, lipid, minerals, and other nutrients, and palatable with good digestion with applicability in the poultry and livestock industry [87, 88].8. Conclusion
Cichorium intybus has a long tradition of use globally. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. This multipurpose plant contains high amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and mineral elements [9]. Inulin from chicory roots is considered a functional food ingredient as it affects physiological and biochemical processes resulting in better health and reduction of the risk of many diseases [89].To date, chicory remains an extremely versatile plant, amenable to genetic manipulation, and there is interest shown in genetically engineered chicory to obtain higher yields and create new potentials [1]. The documented indigenous knowledge relating to the various medicinal uses of chicory has been supported by phytochemical isolation and investigations into biological activity. Nonetheless, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential and further research is necessary to gain better understanding of the phytochemicals against various diseases [9]. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited; however, considering that the Asteraceae family is a known source of allergic problems, a contraindication for hypersensitivity should be included in the safety data [5]. Recent studies suggest the use of C. intybus as a biomonitor for heavy metals [90, 91]; considering that chicory enters the food chain, this plant should be used with caution. The apparent bioactivity of C. intybus shown in preclinical studies (both in vitro and in vivo) is a testament to its historical use in traditional medicine.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThe South African Medical Research Council, University of South Africa and the HOD, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India, are thanked for their support.References1.

Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[4] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber.[5]
Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock.[6] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely naturalized.[7][8][9] "Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia); these two closely related species are often confused.[10]

Names[edit]
Common chicory is also known as blue daisy, blue dandelion, blue sailors, blue weed, bunk, coffeeweed, cornflower, hendibeh, horseweed, ragged sailors, succory, wild bachelor's buttons, and wild endive.[11] (Note: "Cornflower" is commonly applied to Centaurea cyanus.)  Common names for varieties of var. foliosum include endive, radicchio, radichetta, Belgian endive, French endive, red endive, sugarloaf, and witloof (or witlof).

Description[edit]
When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem, from 30 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) tall.  The leaves are stalked, lanceolate and unlobed.  The flower heads are 2 to 4 cm (​1⁄4 to ​1 1⁄2 inches) wide, and usually light purple or lavender (see picture) and it has been described as light blue, rarely white or pink.  Of the two rows of involucral bracts, the inner is longer and erect, the outer is shorter and spreading. It flowers from July until October.  The achenes have no pappus (feathery hairs), but do have toothed scales on top.[12]

Culinary uses[edit]
Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been cultivated in Europe as a coffee substitute.[13] The roots are baked, roasted, ground, and used as an additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and southern United States, particularly in New Orleans. In France a mixture of 60% chicory and 40% coffee is sold as Ricoré. It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and during World War II in Continental Europe. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye, was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "East German coffee crisis" of 1976–79. It is also added to coffee in Spanish,  Greek, Turkish, Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian cuisines.[14]
Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to stouts (commonly expected to have a coffee-like flavour). Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.

Leaf chicory[edit]
Wild[edit]
Wild chicory leaves usually have a bitter taste. Their bitterness is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the Ligurian and Apulian regions of Italy and also in the southern part of India.  In Ligurian cuisine,  wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of preboggion and in Greek cuisine of horta; in the Apulian region, wild chicory leaves are combined with fava bean puree in the traditional local dish fave e cicorie selvatiche.[15] In Albania, the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of byrek.
By cooking and discarding the water, the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be sautéed with garlic, anchovies, and other ingredients. In this form, the resulting greens might be combined with pasta[16] or accompany meat dishes.[17]

Cultivated[edit]
Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as salad leaves. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:[18]

Radicchio usually has variegated red or red and green leaves. Some only refer to the white-veined red-leaved type as radicchio, also known as red endive and red chicory. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted. It can also be used to add color and zest to salads. It is largely used in Italy in different varieties, the most famous being the ones from Treviso (known as radicchio rosso di Treviso),[19][20] from Verona (radicchio di Verona), and Chioggia (radicchio di Chioggia), which are classified as an IGP.[21] It is also common in Greece.[citation needed]
Sugarloaf looks rather like cos lettuce, with tightly packed leaves.[22]
 Witloof, Belgian endive
Belgian endive is known in Dutch as witloof or witlof ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States,[23] indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of northern France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors in the absence of sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves.  It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour.  The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem at the bottom of the head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness.  Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium.[24] Today France is the largest producer of endive.[25]
Catalogna chicory (Cichorium intybus var. foliosum), also known as puntarelle, includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from radicchio)[26] of chicory and is used throughout Italy.
 Leaves unlobed and pointed
 Inflorescences of a blue-flowered form, note the two rows of bracts
Although leaf chicory is often called "endive", true endive (Cichorium endivia) is a different species in the genus, distinct from Belgian endive.

Chicory root and inulin[edit]
Around 1970, it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin, a polysaccharide similar to starch. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon, etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power 10% that of sucrose[27] and is sometimes added to yogurts as a prebiotic. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble dietary fiber and functional food.[28]
Chicory root extract is a dietary supplement or food additive produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the insoluble fraction by filtration and centrifugation.   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of soluble fiber.  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% inulin, 14% sucrose, 5% cellulose, 6% protein, 4% ash, and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, about 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.[29]
Fresh chicory root may contain between 13 and 23% inulin, by total weight.[30]

Agents responsible for bitterness[edit]
The bitter substances are primarily the two sesquiterpene lactones, lactucin and lactucopicrin. Other ingredients are aesculetin, aesculin, cichoriin, umbelliferone, scopoletin, 6,7-dihydrocoumarin, and further sesquiterpene lactones and their glycosides.[31]

Chicory root contains essential oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus Tanacetum.[32]
In traditional medicine, chicory has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies.[33] According to Cancer Research UK, "essence therapists believe that using essences can help to increase your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing ... Essences are not used to prevent, control, or cure cancer or any other physical condition."[34]

Forage[edit]
Chicory is highly digestible for ruminants and has a low fiber concentration.[35] Chicory roots are an "excellent substitute for oats" for horses due to their protein and fat content.[36] Chicory contains a low quantity of reduced tannins[35] that may increase protein utilization efficiency in ruminants.
Some tannins reduce intestinal parasites.[37][38] Dietary chicory may be toxic to internal parasites, with studies of ingesting chicory by farm animals having lower worm burdens, leading to its use as a forage supplement.[39][40][41] Although chicory might have originated in France, Italy, and India,[42] much development of chicory for use with livestock has taken place in New Zealand.[43]

Forage chicory varieties[edit]

Puna (Grasslands Puna)
Developed in New Zealand, Grasslands Puna is well adapted to different climates, being grown from Alberta, Canada, to New Mexico and Florida. It is resistant to bolting, which leads to high nutrient levels in the leaves in spring. It also has high resistance to grazing.
Forage Feast
A variety from France used for human consumption and also for wildlife plots, where animals such as deer might graze. It is very cold-hardy, and being lower in tannins than other forage varieties, is suitable for human consumption.
Choice
Choice has been bred for high winter and early-spring growth activity, and lower amounts of lactucin and lactone, which are believed to taint milk. It is also use for seeding deer wildlife plots.
Oasis
Oasis was bred for increased lactone rates for the forage industry, and for higher resistance to fungal diseases such as Sclerotinia.[clarification needed]
Puna II
This variety is more winter-active than most others, which leads to greater persistence and longevity.
Grouse
A New Zealand variety, it is  used as a planting companion for forage brassicas. More prone to early flowering than other varieties, it has higher crowns more susceptible to overbrowsing.
Six Point
A United States variety, it is very similar to Puna.
History[edit]
The chicory plant is one of the earliest cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance").[44] In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importation of coffee into Prussia, leading to the development of a coffee substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Förster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795, 22 to 24 factories of this type were in Brunswick.[45][46] Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779[47] as the "chicoree", which the French cultivated as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France, chicory frequently appeared as an adulterant in coffee, or as a coffee substitute.[48] Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, has been on sale since 1885.
The cultivated chicory plant has a history reaching back to ancient Egyptian time.[citation needed] Medieval monks raised the plants and when coffee was introduced to Europe, the Dutch thought that chicory made a lively addition to the bean drink.
In the United States, chicory root has long been used as a substitute for coffee in prisons.[49] By the 1840s, the port of New Orleans was the second-largest importer of coffee (after New York).[48] Louisianans began to add chicory root to their coffee when Union naval blockades during the American Civil War cut off the port of New Orleans, thereby creating a long-standing tradition.[48]
A common meal in Rome, puntarelle, is made with chicory sprouts.[50] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports that chicory is a native plant of western Asia, North Africa, and Europe.[4]
Chicory is also mentioned in certain silk-growing texts. The primary caretaker of the silkworms, the "silkworm mother", should not eat or even touch it.[citation needed]
The chicory flower is often seen as inspiration for the Romantic concept of the Blue Flower (e.g. in German language Blauwarte ≈ blue lookout by the wayside). It could open locked doors, according to European folklore.[51]

Cichorium intybus, commonly known as chicory, is well known as a coffee substitute but is also widely used medicinally to treat various ailments ranging from wounds to diabetes. Although this plant has a rich history of use in folklore, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.1. IntroductionThe genus Cichorium (Asteraceae) consists of six species with major distribution areas in Europe and Asia [1]. In several Asteraceae, inulin, a β-2,1 linked fructose polymer with a terminal glucose residue, functions as a reserve carbohydrate in stems, tubers, and taproots [2]. Cichorium intybus L., commonly known as chicory, is an erect fairly woody perennial herb, around 1 m in height with a fleshy taproot of up to 75 cm in length and large basal leaves [1, 3]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the root of C. intybus contained up to 40% inulin, which has a negligible impact on blood sugar and thus is suitable for diabetics [4]. To date, C. intybus is grown for the production of inulin on an industrial scale [2]. The name of the plant is derived from Greek and Latin. Cichorium means field and intybus is partly derived from the Greek “to cut”, because of the leaves, and partly from the Latin tubus to indicate the hollow stem [5].Chicory is a hardy plant and can endure extreme temperatures during both vegetative and reproductive growth stages [1]. When broken, all plant parts exudate a milky latex [3]. Cichorium intybus is cultivated for numerous applications and can be divided into four main varieties or cultigroups according to their use [6]: (1) “industrial” or “root” chicory, predominantly cultivated in northwestern Europe, India, South Africa, and Chile, produces the taproot as a coffee substitute or for inulin extraction; (2) “Brussels” or “witloof” chicory is commonly cultivated around Europe as industrial chicory for etiolated buds (chicons) by forcing; (3) “leaf” chicory is used as fresh or cooked vegetables; and (4) “forage” chicory, initially derived from wild chicory commonly found along roadsides and waste areas, has been used since the mid-1970s to intensify herbage obtainability in perennial pastures for livestock.
Cichorium intybus is a medicinally important plant in Eurasia and in parts of Africa. Despite its long tradition of use, the plant is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in any official Pharmacopoeia of a European Union member state [5]. However, due to its prevalent distribution, different parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicines globally [7]. Important phytochemicals are distributed throughout the plant, but the main contents are present in the root [1]. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.2. Traditional UsesMedicinal plants have been used for centuries and numerous cultures still rely on indigenous medicinal plants to meet their primary health care needs. It is likely that the insightful knowledge of plant-based remedies in traditional cultures advanced through trial and error and that the most important cures were carefully passed from one generation to another [8]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant [9] and it has had a long history of therapeutic use both in areas where it is indigenous and in areas where it has been introduced. The various common or local names describing this plant may be ascribed to the widespread use by different folkloric groups. Different preparations of this plant are employed to treat various symptoms and ailments (Table 1). The juice is said to be a folk remedy for cancer of the uterus and for tumors [4]. In South Africa, although it is considered a widespread weed, leaves, stems, and roots are made into a tea for jaundice and chicory syrup is used as a tonic and purifying medicine for infants [3]. In Turkey, an ointment is made from the leaves for wound healing [10]. Decoction refers to a preparation that is made by adding cold water to the plant material which is then boiled and allowed to simmer for 5–10 min after which it is strained [8]. Chicory decoctions are traditionally made from individual plant parts and/or from the plant as a whole (Table 1).Table 1Traditional medicinal uses of Cichorium intybus.CountryTraditional use(s)Plant part(s)Preparation(s)ReferenceAfghanistanMalariaRootAqueous extract[12]

Prior to the wars in Afghanistan, folkloric reports described the use of aqueous root extracts as a light-sensitive plant remedy for malaria. This indigenous knowledge has since been confirmed and the antimalarial compounds of C. intybus roots have been identified as the light-sensitive sesquiterpene lactones lactucin and lactucopicrin [12]. The flowers of the chicory plant (Cichorii flos) are used as a herbal treatment of everyday ailments such as a tonic and appetite stimulant and as a treatment of gallstones, gastroenteritis, sinus problems, cuts, and bruises [4]. In Italy, the whorls are made into a decoction and used as a depurative [13]. Chicory seeds are one of the main ingredients of Jigrine, a commercial product of India used for the treatment of various diseases of the liver [14]. Other plant parts are also used for liver disorders, namely, aerial parts in Bosnia and Herzegovina [15] and roots in Serbia and India [16, 17].3. Chemical ConstituentsChicoric acid has been identified as the major compound in methanolic extracts of chicory (Table 2) [18]. Aliphatic compounds and their derivatives comprise the main fraction while terpenoids comprise minor constituents of the plant. The flowers of chicory contain saccharides, methoxycoumarin cichorine, flavonoids, essential oils [4], and anthocyanins contributing to the blue colour of the perianth [19]. Table 2 provides a summary of the compounds isolated and identified from chicory. Octane, n-nonadecane, pentadecanone, hexadecane, and a tentatively identified compound have been found as principal volatile components [4]. A list of volatile compounds is given in Table 3.Table 2Compounds isolated and identified from Cichorium intybus (chicory).CompoundReference(s)Lactucin [12, 31, 103] Lactucopicrin[12, 31]8-Deoxylactucin[31, 104]Jacquilenin[103]11β,13-Dihydrolactucin[103]11,13-Dihydrolactucopicrin[103, 104]Crepidiaside B [103]Cyanidin 3-O-p-(6-O-malonyl)-D-glucopyranoside[105]3,4β-Dihydro-15-dehydrolactucopicrin[103]Magnolialide[103]Ixerisoside D[103]Loliolide[103]Cichorioside B[103, 104]Sonchuside A[103, 104]Artesin [103]Cichoriolide[103]Cichorioside[103]Sonchuside C [103]Cichopumilide[103]Putrescine[83]Spermidine[83]

Cichorium intybus presents a little investigated plant in terms of phytochemistry and pharmacology. Over 100 individual compounds have been isolated and identified from this plant (Table 2), the majority of which are from the roots. Most of the pharmacological studies on this plant document the testing of aqueous and/or alcoholic extracts only. Apart from the pharmacologically important activities, the use of C. intybus (hairy root cultures) has also been implicated in the phytoremediation of DDT [20].4.1. Antimicrobial ActivityThe antibacterial activity of the organic acid-rich extract of fresh red chicory (C. intybus var. sylvestre) was tested against periodontopathic bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Prevotella intermedia. The compounds identified from the active extract include oxalic acid, succinic acid, quinic acid, and shikimic acid. All of the organic acids were found to decrease biofilm formation and adhesion of bacteria to the cells, with different levels of efficacy. These compounds also induced biofilm disruption and detachment of dead cells for the cultured substratum [21]. In other reports on the antimicrobial activity of C. intybus, the crude aqueous and organic seed extracts were found to be active against four pathogenic microorganisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, and root extracts had pronounced effects on Bacillus subtilis, S. aureus, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and E. coli [22, 23]. The leaf extract of C. intybus also showed a moderate activity against multidrug resistant S. typhi [24]. Guaianolides-rich root extracts of C. intybus have shown antifungal properties against anthropophilic fungi Trichophyton tonsurans, T. rubrum, and T. violaceum [25]. A sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin cichoralexin isolated from chicory exhibited potent antifungal activity against Pseudomonas cichorii [26].4.2. Anthelmintic ActivitySeveral studies have been conducted on grazing animals to determine the anthelmintic potential of secondary metabolites present in C. intybus. Grossly, it has been concluded that the animals grazing on chicory have a higher performance index and lower incidence of gastrointestinal nematode infestations. In the majority of the experiments, the condensed tannins and sesquiterpene lactones were responsible for anthelmintic activity [27]. Anthelmintic activity of chicory has also been noticed in the case of lambs wherein the total number of abomasal helminths was found to be lesser in the lambs grazing on this plant [28]. The condensed tannin and sesquiterpene-rich extracts of C. intybus were evaluated for their efficacy against the larvae of deer lungworm, Dictyocaulus viviparous and other gastrointestinal nematode larvae using a larval migration inhibition assay. A dose-dependent decrease in the larval motility was observed in both lungworm and gastrointestinal nematodes [29]. The sesquiterpene lactone-rich extracts of C. intybus were also found to inhibit egg hatching of Haemonchus contortus [30].4.3. Antimalarial ActivityThe infusion of fresh roots of C. intybus has a history of use as a remedy for malarial fevers in some parts of Afghanistan. The bitter compounds in the plant, namely, lactucin, lactucopicrin, and the guaianolide sesquiterpenes, isolated from aqueous root extracts of chicory were concluded to be the antimalarial components of the plant. Lactucin and lactucopicrin completely inhibited the HB3 clone of strain Honduras-1 of Plasmodium falciparum at concentrations of 10 and 50 μg/mL, respectively [12, 31].4.4. Hepatoprotective ActivityThe folkloric use of C. intybus as a hepatoprotectant has been well documented. It is one of the herbal components of Liv-52, a traditional Indian tonic used widely for hepatoprotection. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted on cirrhotic patients, Liv-52 medication reduced the serum levels of hepatic enzymes, namely, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. It also reduced the Child-Pugh scores and ascites significantly [32]. Another polyherbal formulation, Jigrine, contains the leaves of C. intybus as one of its 14 constituents. Jigrine was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activity against galactosamine-induced hepatopathy in rats. The pretreatment of male Wistar-albino rats with jigrine significantly reduced the levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and urea and increased the levels of blood and tissue glutathione. Histopathological examination of the liver revealed that jigrine pretreatment prevented galactosamine toxicity and caused a marked decrease in inflamed cells [33].The aqueous-methanolic extract of the seeds of C. intybus has been investigated for the hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in mice. It was found to decrease both the death rate and the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamyl pyruvate transaminase [34]. In analogous studies, the antihepatotoxic activity of the alcoholic extract of the seeds and aqueous extracts of the roots and root callus of C. intybus was estimated. The oral administration of these extracts in albino rats led to a marked decrease in the levels of hepatic enzymes. Also, histopathological examination of the liver showed no fat accumulation or necrosis after the treatment [14, 35]. Similar studies have established the hepatoprotective effect of esculetin, a phenolic compound, and cichotyboside, a guaianolide sesquiterpene glycoside reported from C. intybus [36, 37].The carbon tetrachloride and paracetamol-induced liver toxicities were also found to be counteracted by intraperitoneal administration of crude extracts and fractions of C. intybus. The methanol- and water-soluble fractions exhibited marked reductions in serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. In the same study, toxicity was induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with galactosamine and thioacetamide [38].The phenolic acid-rich seed extract of C. intybus was evaluated for its efficacy against hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro model of hepatic steatosis was created by incubation of the HepG2 cells with oleic acid leading to intracellular accumulation of fat. The seed extract was effective in decreasing the deposited fat from the cells in case of administration after the initial fat deposition (i.e., nonsimultaneous administration with oleic acid). However, in case of simultaneous administration of seed extract and oleic acid, the extract could not protect the cells from steatosis except at very high doses. The extract also led to the increased release of glycerol (an indicator of triglyceride degradation) in steatotic cells. In case of nonsimultaneous administration, the extract was found to upregulate the expression of SREBP-1c and PPAR-α genes leading to restoration of normal levels of corresponding proteins. In the in vivo model of hepatic steatosis, namely, diabetic rats, treatment with seed extract resulted in significant decrease in fat accumulation and fibrosis [39].The hepatoprotective activity of C. intybus has been correlated to its ability to inhibit the free radical mediated damage. A fraction prepared from the ethanolic extract of the leaves was assessed for preventive action on the free radical mediated damage to the deoxyribose sugar of the DNA (obtained from calf thymus). A dose-dependent decrease in the DNA damage was observed in the present assay [40].4.5. Antidiabetic ActivityChicory has reported antidiabetic activity [17, 41]. Based on the traditional use of C. intybus in diabetes mellitus, the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of the ethanol extract of the whole plant were investigated. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ethanol extract, at a dose of 125 mg/Kg body weight, significantly attenuated the serum glucose levels in the oral glucose tolerance test. A marked decrease in the serum triglycerides and cholesterol was also observed in the extract-treated rats. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found to be reduced in extract-treated diabetic rats as compared to untreated diabetic rats [17]. The antidiabetic effect of the aqueous seed extract of C. intybus has also been investigated. Early-stage and late-stage diabetes were differently induced in male Wistar albino rats by streptozotocin-niacinamide and streptozotocin alone, respectively. The treatment with chicory extract prevented weight loss in both early-stage and late-stage diabetic rats. Chicory-treated diabetic animals resisted excessive increase in fasting blood sugar (assessed by glucose tolerance test). Grossly, normalization of blood parameters, namely, alanine aminotransferase, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and glycosylated heamoglobin, was seen in these animals. In early-stage diabetic rats, chicory treatment led to the increase in insulin levels pointing toward the insulin-sensitizing action of chicory [42].Feeding the diabetic Wistar rats with C. intybus leaf powder led to a decrease in blood glucose levels to near normal value. C. intybus administration also decreased the malondialdehyde (formed by thiobarbituric acid) levels and increased glutathione content. Anticholinesterase activity was restored to near normal, brain lipopolysaccharide decreased, and catalase activity increased [43]. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid have been described as potential antidiabetic agents by increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells. Both compounds were also able to stimulate insulin secretion from an insulin-secreting cell line and islets of Langerhans. Another compound, chicoric acid, is also a new potential antidiabetic agent exhibiting both insulin-sensitizing and insulin-secreting properties [44].4.6. Gastroprotective Activity
C. intybus has been used in Turkish folklore for its antiulcerogenic potency. The aqueous decoction of C. intybus roots was orally administered to Sprague-Dawley rats 15 minutes before the induction of ulcerogenesis by ethanol. More than 95% inhibition of ulcerogenesis was observed in the test group [45].4.7. Anti-Inflammatory ActivityThe inhibition of TNF-α mediated cyclooxygenase (COX) induction by chicory root extracts was investigated in the human colon carcinoma (HT 29) cell line. The ethyl acetate extract inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-α mediated induction of COX-2 expression was also suppressed by the chicory extract [46].4.8. Analgesic ActivityLactucin, lactucopicrin, and 11β, 13-dihydrolactucin exhibited analgesic action in mice in hot plate and tail-flick tests. In the hot plate test, all three compounds exerted an analgesic effect, with lactucopicrin being the most potent compound. In the tail-flick test, the antinociceptive effects of all the tested compounds (30 mg/kg dose) were comparable to that of ibuprofen (60 mg/kg dose). Lactucin and lactucopicrin were also established to have some sedative action as evident from the decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in mice [47].4.9. Antioxidant ActivityThe DPPH radical scavenging activity of a polyphenols-rich fraction of C. intybus has been investigated [48]. The anti- and prooxidant activities of Cichorium species were studied in chemical as well as biological systems. In the case of chemical systems, the antioxidant activity of water-soluble compounds in C. intybus var. silvestre was established in the coupled model of linoleic acid and β-carotene. A pro-oxidant activity of some of the chemical components was recorded initially which notably diminished with time and/or thermal treatment. Thereafter, the antioxidant activity of the raw juice and its fractions persisted. The molecular weight ranges of the antioxidant fractions of raw juice were also identified based on dialysis [49]. Two varieties of chicory, namely, C. intybus var. silvestre and C. intybus var. foliosum, have been investigated for their antioxidant (antiradical) activities in two distinct biological systems. The lipid peroxidation assay has been carried out on microsome membranes of rat hepatocytes after the induction of oxidative damage by carbon tetrachloride. The antiradical activity was expressed as the protective activity against lipid peroxidation and calculated as the percentage decrease in hydroperoxide degradation products. The second biological system used was the cultures of S. aureus after treatment with cumene hydroperoxide. The percentage increase of growth of bacteria was noted after the treatment with juices of chicory varieties. In both systems, the juices of chicory varieties showed strong antiradical activities [21, 49].Red chicory (C. intybus var. silvestre) was studied for its polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by using the synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical and three model reactions catalyzed by pertinent enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species, namely, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and diaphorase. Total phenolics were significantly correlated with the antioxidant activity evaluated with both the synthetic radical and the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. On a molar basis, red chicory phenolics were as efficient as Trolox (reference compound) in scavenging the synthetic radical [50]. The aqueous-alcoholic extracts of the aerial parts of C. intybus also inhibited xanthine oxidase enzyme dose dependently [51]. In another study, along with DPPH radical scavenging activity, C. intybus also exhibited inhibition of hydrogen peroxide and chelation of ferrous ion [52].4.10. Tumor-Inhibitory ActivityThe crude ethanolic extract of C. intybus roots caused a significant inhibition of Ehrlich tumor carcinoma in mice. A 70% increase in the life span was observed with a 500 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal dose of the tested extract [53]. The aqueous-alcoholic macerate of the leaves of C. intybus also exerted an antiproliferative effect on amelanotic melanoma C32 cell lines [54]. Magnolialide, a 1β-hydroxyeudesmanolide isolated from the roots of C. intybus, inhibited several tumor cell lines and induced the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells to monocyte or macrophage-like cells [55].4.11. Antiallergic ActivityThe aqueous extract of C. intybus inhibited the mast cell-mediated immediate allergic reactions in vitro as well as in vivo. This extract restrained the systemic anaphylactic reaction in mice in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction caused by anti-dinitrophenyl IgE in rats. Other markers of allergic reaction, namely, plasma histamine levels and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, decreased significantly whereas the levels of cAMP increased after the treatment with C. intybus extract [56].4.12. Other Pharmacologically Important ActivitiesThe ethanol extract of the roots of C. intybus is reported to prevent the immunotoxic effects of ethanol in ICR mice. It was noted that body weight gains were markedly decreased in mice administered with ethanol. However, the body weight was not affected when ethanol was coadministered with the ethanol extract of C. intybus. Similarly, the weights of liver and spleen were not affected when ethanol extract was given along with ethanol. A considerable restoration in the other markers of immunity, namely, hemagglutination titer, plaque forming cells of spleen, secondary IgG antibody production, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (in response to subcutaneous administration of sheep red-blood cells to paw), phagocytic activity, number of circulating leucocytes, NK cell activity, cell proliferation, and production of interferon-γ, was registered [57]. The immunoactive potential of an aqueous-alcoholic extract of the roots was established by a mitogen proliferation assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The extract showed an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of phytohemagglutinin and a stimulatory effect on MLR [58].Chicoric acid has shown vasorelaxant activity against nor-epinephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta strips [59]. A pronounced anticholinesterase activity of the dichloromethane extract of C. intybus roots was seen in the enzyme assay with Ellman's reagent. Two sesquiterpene lactones, namely, 8-deoxylactucin and lactucopicrin, also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of anticholinesterase [60]. The methanolic extract displays wound healing effect and β-sitosterol was determined as the active compound responsible for the activity, possibly due to its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibition [7].5. Toxicological StudiesAlthough C. intybus has a long history of human use, the high levels of secondary metabolites have shown potential toxicological effects. To evaluate the safety of the root extract of C. intybus, Ames test and subchronic toxicity assessment were conducted. The sesquiterpene-rich extract was evaluated for potential mutagenic properties (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA1535 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. Though cytotoxicity was observed at high extract doses in some strains, mutagenicity was not noted. A 28-day (subchronic) oral toxicity study, conducted in CRL:CD (SD) IGS BR rats, concluded that there was no extract-related mortality or any other signs of toxicological significance [61]. The toxicity evaluation of C. intybus extracts has also been done by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test (Microtox acute toxicity test). This bacterial test measures the decrease in light emission from the marine luminescent bacteria V. fischeri when exposed to organic extracts. The tested extracts showed less than 20% inhibition of bioluminescence and hence were concluded to be safe for human use [54].6. Clinical TrialsTwo clinical studies on chicory roots are reported in the literature, both of which are pilot studies and are therefore considered to be insufficient to support a well-established use indication for chicory root [5]. The first study, a phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating trial, was conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) [62]. In general, the treatment was well tolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highest dose of chicory had to discontinue treatment due to an adverse event. The results of the pilot study suggested that a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root has a potential role in the management of OA and merits further investigation. The second pilot study was conducted to assess whether chicory coffee consumption might confer cardiovascular benefits; thus, a clinical intervention was performed with 27 healthy volunteers, who consumed 300 mL chicory coffee daily for one week [63]. Depending on the inducer used for the aggregation test, the dietary intervention showed variable effects on platelet aggregation. Whole blood and plasma viscosity were both significantly reduced, along with serum MIF levels, after a week of chicory coffee intake. It was concluded that the full spectrum of the effects was unlikely to be attributed to a single phytochemical; nevertheless, the phenolics (including caffeic acid) are expected to play a substantial role. The study offered an encouraging starting-point to describe the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds found in chicory coffee.In the European Union, there is currently only one registered/authorized herbal medicinal product containing C. intybus as single ingredient whilst there are several combination products on the market [5]. The efficacy of herbal medicine Liv-52 consisting of Mandur bhasma, Tamarix gallica, and herbal extracts of Capparis spinosa, C. intybus, Solanum nigrum, Terminalia arjuna, and Achillea millefolium on liver cirrhosis outcomes was compared with the placebo for 6 months in 36 cirrhotic patients. The study concluded that Liv-52 possessed a hepatoprotective effect in cirrhotic patients. This protective effect of Liv-52 can be attributed to the diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulating properties of the component herbs [32].7. Cultivation and Sustainable UseGreeks and Romans began to grow chicory as a vegetable crop 4000 years ago [9]. Since the discovery in the 1970s that chicory root contains up to 40% inulin (polysaccharide), new strains have been created, with inulin content comparable to that of sugar beet [4]. It is a common vegetable in several Western European countries. It is typically grown in a biennial cycle, with a tuberised root produced during the vegetative growth phase [64]. During the first field year, the vegetative growth phase is characterized by the production of a fleshy taproot. The second field year is the generative phase in which the flowering stem is formed and seeds are produced. To produce the eatable leafy vegetable called a chicon, roots are harvested at the end of the first growing period when an appropriate stage of maturity is reached [65]. The application of inulin in the food industry was restricted to the production of coffee substitutes. It was later discovered that inulin could act as a substitute for sugar or fat due to its low caloric value. The most stable form for the commercialization of inulin is the powdered extract for its greater facility of manipulation, transport, storage, and consumption [66].Chicory is especially attractive as a cash crop since it can reach more than 62 t ha−1 under favourable conditions. Inulin content can reach on average 15% of root fresh weight and a yield of 8 t ha−1 of inulin is achievable [67]. The USA imports more than 2.3 million kilograms of chicons and 1.9 million kilograms of roasted chicory roots for coffee according to 2002 US Department of Commerce tariff and trade data [61]. Numerous studies have focused on different cultivation aspects of chicory. Chicory is considered one of the most important sources of inulin since it has a high root yield potential and also a high root sugar content [68]. A high root yield, a high inulin content, and especially long inulin chains are preferred [69]. Short chain inulin is used for the production of fructose syrup used in sweetening of cold drinks whereas long chain inulin is used as fat replacer and foam stabilizer in food products and also in the production of carboxymethyl inulin [2]. The effect of fertilizers on the growth, development, and yield of chicory has been well studied. In general, increase of nitrogen (N) increases the growth and ultimately the yield, although a high application of N has a negative effect on especially some of the amino acids. Increased N application at levels of 200 kg N ha−1 leads to a decrease in amino acids such as threonine and valine with a pronounced decreased effect on methionine. A level of 100 kg N ha−1 is preferred for enhanced quality [70]. In terms of phosphorous (P), it has been established that chicory has at least two inherent patterns of response to low or zero P conditions. One pattern is the classical increase in the length of the smallest diameter roots in response to P deficient conditions. The second pattern is a significant decrease in root tissue density under low P conditions [71]. It has also been investigated as a suitable catch crop since it has the ability to withdraw N, especially nitrate, from the soil, thereby reducing potential leaching. Additionally, it can withstand competition, has a slow juvenile development and vigorous growth after harvest of the main crop, is frost- and winter-hardy, has a well-developed root system, and does not transmit pathogens or pests to other crops [72]. Canopy closure in chicory is advantageous and critical for yield and can be achieved by a larger supply of assimilates to the shoot [73].Chicory is greatly influenced by the pH of the soil as this affects the availability of nutrients in the soil to the plant. A study conducted by Anguissola Scotti el al. [74] on two soils of pH, 5.7 and 7.0 indicated that the fly-ash or metal availability to the plant was significantly different at the different pH levels. At a low pH a decrease of Zn, Cu, Cd, and Ni was observed and for neutral soils the added metals are more available to plants than those naturally occurring in soils [75]. Chicory is a cold-requiring long-day plant [72]. In a study by Amaducci and Pritoni [68], it was shown that retarding harvest time significantly affects the content and concentration of inulin. Rainfall has proven to be another important factor since the roots contain a higher water content, thereby affecting the concentration of inulin in the roots. The same results have been obtained in a study by Baert [69] where an early sowing date and harvesting time increased the root yield, total sugar content, and inulin chain length. The increase in yield with an earlier sowing date was up to 30% higher with an increase of 10% with an earlier harvest date. The content of free fructose and sucrose increased and the content of free glucose and inulin decreased with a later harvest time [75].Even though chicory is a cold-requiring plant, cold storage after harvest can cause a strong decrease in free glucose, an increase in free fructose and sucrose, and hydrolysis of inulin [76]. This has also been observed by Ernst et al. [77] where an onset of cooler temperatures and especially colder temperatures during storage resulted in an increase in sucrose and fructose content. It was found that sucrose increased in the roots of chicory about threefold and fructose increased about tenfold within the first few weeks of cold storage after harvest [77]. The effect of storage at reduced temperature has also been studied on the levels of sesquiterpene lactones. Storage at 2°C and 10°C for up to 13 days had no effect on the level of lactucin-like sesquiterpene lactones in the chicons and after 7 days of storage a slight increase of lactucopicrin content was observed [78]. Several types of discoloration, leaf edge damage, and extensive growth of the internal core can occur in the heads of chicory during postharvest storage, which considerably reduces their market value. An atmospheric composition of 10% O2 and 10% CO2 in combination with a storage temperature of 5°C was found optimal [64]. Low temperature in the field also hastens and enhances bolting and flowering [79, 80]. The type and cultivar have been identified in numerous studies to be the determining factor during the stages of growth [81]. Suhonen [82] found the highest numbers of bolters in those being planted last, for which the mean temperatures during early growth were the highest.During the postharvest period, the major polyamines present are putrescine, especially in the oldest leaves, although spermidine is present in considerable amounts, showing a tendency to decrease with the increasing physiological age of the leaves. Free sterol content increases with postharvest and also with physiological age of the leaves. Sitosterol is the major free sterol present, followed by stigmasterol and campesterol [83].Emergence has been reported as one negative aspect of the crop, which could be addressed by specific breeding programmes [68]. Chicory can also be propagated and grown by means of micropropagation by regeneration of meristematic nodules. The leaves are cultivated in vitro and develop into plantlets when transferred to soil [84]. Although chicory can be regenerated in vitro from explants, both through organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, and from protoplasts, no transgenic plants have yet been reported that have been produced [85]. Promising potential utility technologies of the plant have emerged. Chicory roots pulps are an important by-product of the inulin processing industries and are usually used in animal feed. Other applications can be found for these materials since the extraction of chicory pulp yields high levels of pectin, a polysaccharide extensively used in food as a gelling agent, thickening agent, and stabilizer [86]. The crude protein content in chicory is more valuable than in alfalfa. Furthermore the crude lipid in chicory is generally higher than most varieties of alfalfa [9]. It also has a nutritional quality comparable to lucerne, with a mineral content superior for copper and zinc, with similar proportions of protein, lipid, minerals, and other nutrients, and palatable with good digestion with applicability in the poultry and livestock industry [87, 88].8. Conclusion
Cichorium intybus has a long tradition of use globally. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. This multipurpose plant contains high amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and mineral elements [9]. Inulin from chicory roots is considered a functional food ingredient as it affects physiological and biochemical processes resulting in better health and reduction of the risk of many diseases [89].To date, chicory remains an extremely versatile plant, amenable to genetic manipulation, and there is interest shown in genetically engineered chicory to obtain higher yields and create new potentials [1]. The documented indigenous knowledge relating to the various medicinal uses of chicory has been supported by phytochemical isolation and investigations into biological activity. Nonetheless, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential and further research is necessary to gain better understanding of the phytochemicals against various diseases [9]. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited; however, considering that the Asteraceae family is a known source of allergic problems, a contraindication for hypersensitivity should be included in the safety data [5]. Recent studies suggest the use of C. intybus as a biomonitor for heavy metals [90, 91]; considering that chicory enters the food chain, this plant should be used with caution. The apparent bioactivity of C. intybus shown in preclinical studies (both in vitro and in vivo) is a testament to its historical use in traditional medicine.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThe South African Medical Research Council, University of South Africa and the HOD, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India, are thanked for their support.References1.

Table Of Content





It is popularly known as chicory and sometimes also referred to as blue sailors or succory. This plant has many varieties that are cultivated throughout the world. Chicory is native to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, northern and southern Africa and America.
The chicory root is significant for its use as a coffee substitute and additive. Furthermore its leaves are used in the preparation of salads and can also be cooked and eaten.
Chichorium Intybus is also regarded as a miracle herb that has been famous ever since for its medicinal uses.
Cichorium Intybus Description
The beauty of the Chicory plant is as mystic as the legends associated with it.
Stem: When the plant starts to bloom, the stems appear sturdy, grooved and more or less hairy. These stems are approximately 30-100 centimeters in height.
Leaf: The plant leaves do not have lobes and are narrow and tapering, somewhat like a pointed apex in appearance. Another noteworthy characteristic about the leaves is that they are stalked.
Flower: The flowers of the chichorium intybus appear bright blue, with a hint of purple color. However in rare scenarios the flowers may also be white or pink. The pretty flower heads are about 2-4 centimeters wide. The two rows of bracts protecting the inflorescence are conspicuously evident with the long and erect inner bracts and comparatively shorter outer bracts. The plant blooms in the time period between July and October. It is interesting to note how these flowers open up and expand in the morning and close up as noon approaches. It is also equally astonishing how each bloom can last only for one single day!
Fruit: The fruits or achenes are distinguished by the toothed scales on the apex. These plant fruits do not have calyx or feathery hairs on the body.

Bioactive products found in Cichorium intybus


Mechanism of Action
Pharmacology:

Constituents: The active compounds in chicory are inulin, sesquiterpene lactones, vitamins, minerals, fat, mannitol and latex. Fructans have been extracted from chicory roots.10 
The postulated biosynthesis of sesquiterpene lactones through the mevalonate-farnesyl diphosphate-germacradiene pathway has been confirmed by the isolation of a (+)-germacrene A synthase from chicory roots.11 
Chemical constituents of Cichorium intybus L. were identified as alpha-amyrin, taraxerone, baurenyl acetate and beta-sitosterol.12 Inulooligosaccharides (IOS) production from chicory extract was carried out using endoinulinase obtained from a new isolate, Xanthomonas oryzae No. 5.13 Twelve compounds were isolated from the root of Cichorium intybus including 2, 3, 4, 9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido-(3,4-b)indole-3-carboxylic acid.14 
Antiallergic effects: Cichorium intybus inhibits mast cell-mediated immediate-type allergic reactions in vivo and in vitro.15 
Antihyperlipidemic effects: Inulin decreases serum triglycerides by decreasing fatty acid synthesis and reducing production of low density lipoproteins (VLDL).7 
Anti-inflammatory effects: Chicory has been found to inhibit prostaglandin E(2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2).1 
Antineoplastic effects: Chicory derived beta (2-1) fructans have been shown to exert cancer protective effects in animal models.16,3 
Chicory fructan supplements inhibit aberrant crypt foci formation, an early preneoplastic marker of malignant potential in the process of colon Carcinogenesis.17 
Calcium homeostasis activity: The leaves of chicory maintain calcium levels by heterologous expression of total RNA.2,5,18 
Cytochrome P450 activity: Chicory is known to contain guaianolides, eudesmanolides, and germacranolides. The biosynthesis of these sesquiterpene lactones are involved with the cytochrome P450 enzyme.9,19 
Fecal bulking properties: Inulin and oligofructose are considered dietary fibers. They share the basic common characteristics of dietary fibers including saccharides of plant origin, resistance to digestion and absorption in the small intestine, and fermentation in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids that are absorbed and metabolized in various parts of the body. Moreover, this fermentation induced by difidobacteria has a bulking effect.20 Fermentation of inulin decreases fecal pH and increases fecal volume.8 
Hypoglycemic effect: One animal study concluded dietary inulin-type fructans extracted from chicory root may modulate the production of peptides, such as incretins, by endocrine cells present in the intestinal mucosa. This effect may play a role in the management of obesity and diabetes through their capacity to promote secretion of endogenous gastrointestinal peptides involved in appetite regulation.4 
Immunostimulatory activity: Oligofructose and inulin, selective fermentable chicory fructans, have been shown to stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria, which are regarded as beneficial strains in the colon.21,22,23 
Chicory and mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) alter fecal microbial populations and certain indices of the immune system.24 
Mutagenic properties: Chicory powder has shown very weak mutagenic activity of commonly consumed food dishes in South India.25 
Prebiotic effect: One clinical trial assessed the prebiotic effect of an Fn-type chicory inulin hydrolysate product.6 The F is for fructose and the n is the number of b(2->1) bound fructose moieties. Eight subjects (5 females and 3 males) consumed 8g daily of an Fn-rich chicory inulin product for up to 5 weeks. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed for total anaerobes, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, bacteroides, coliforms and Clostridium perfringens. Both 2 and 5-week of oligofructose feeding resulted in a selective increase in bifidobacteria (p< 0.01). A daily intake of 8g of Fn-type oligofructose preparation reduced fecal pH and caused little intestinal discomfort.

Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[4] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae. It usually has bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink.[5]
It is often used as a food plant, and often as a coffee substitute. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots. The roots of variety sativum are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. 
In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fibre.[6]
Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock.[7] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely introduced.[8][9][10]
"Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia). These two closely related species are often confused.[11]

Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[4] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber.[5]
Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock.[6] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely naturalized.[7][8][9] "Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia); these two closely related species are often confused.[10]

Names[edit]
Common chicory is also known as blue daisy, blue dandelion, blue sailors, blue weed, bunk, coffeeweed, cornflower, hendibeh, horseweed, ragged sailors, succory, wild bachelor's buttons, and wild endive.[11] (Note: "Cornflower" is commonly applied to Centaurea cyanus.)  Common names for varieties of var. foliosum include endive, radicchio, radichetta, Belgian endive, French endive, red endive, sugarloaf, and witloof (or witlof).

Description[edit]
When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem, from 30 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) tall.  The leaves are stalked, lanceolate and unlobed.  The flower heads are 2 to 4 cm (​1⁄4 to ​1 1⁄2 inches) wide, and usually light purple or lavender (see picture) and it has been described as light blue, rarely white or pink.  Of the two rows of involucral bracts, the inner is longer and erect, the outer is shorter and spreading. It flowers from July until October.  The achenes have no pappus (feathery hairs), but do have toothed scales on top.[12]

Culinary uses[edit]
Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been cultivated in Europe as a coffee substitute.[13] The roots are baked, roasted, ground, and used as an additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and southern United States, particularly in New Orleans. In France a mixture of 60% chicory and 40% coffee is sold as Ricoré. It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and during World War II in Continental Europe. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye, was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "East German coffee crisis" of 1976–79. It is also added to coffee in Spanish,  Greek, Turkish, Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian cuisines.[14]
Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to stouts (commonly expected to have a coffee-like flavour). Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.

Leaf chicory[edit]
Wild[edit]
Wild chicory leaves usually have a bitter taste. Their bitterness is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the Ligurian and Apulian regions of Italy and also in the southern part of India.  In Ligurian cuisine,  wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of preboggion and in Greek cuisine of horta; in the Apulian region, wild chicory leaves are combined with fava bean puree in the traditional local dish fave e cicorie selvatiche.[15] In Albania, the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of byrek.
By cooking and discarding the water, the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be sautéed with garlic, anchovies, and other ingredients. In this form, the resulting greens might be combined with pasta[16] or accompany meat dishes.[17]

Cultivated[edit]
Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as salad leaves. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:[18]

Radicchio usually has variegated red or red and green leaves. Some only refer to the white-veined red-leaved type as radicchio, also known as red endive and red chicory. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted. It can also be used to add color and zest to salads. It is largely used in Italy in different varieties, the most famous being the ones from Treviso (known as radicchio rosso di Treviso),[19][20] from Verona (radicchio di Verona), and Chioggia (radicchio di Chioggia), which are classified as an IGP.[21] It is also common in Greece.[citation needed]
Sugarloaf looks rather like cos lettuce, with tightly packed leaves.[22]
 Witloof, Belgian endive
Belgian endive is known in Dutch as witloof or witlof ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States,[23] indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of northern France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors in the absence of sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves.  It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour.  The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem at the bottom of the head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness.  Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium.[24] Today France is the largest producer of endive.[25]
Catalogna chicory (Cichorium intybus var. foliosum), also known as puntarelle, includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from radicchio)[26] of chicory and is used throughout Italy.

Although leaf chicory is often called "endive", true endive (Cichorium endivia) is a different species in the genus, distinct from Belgian endive.

Chicory root and inulin[edit]
Around 1970, it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin, a polysaccharide similar to starch. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon, etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power 10% that of sucrose[27] and is sometimes added to yogurts as a prebiotic. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble dietary fiber and functional food.[28]
Chicory root extract is a dietary supplement or food additive produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the insoluble fraction by filtration and centrifugation.   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of soluble fiber.  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% inulin, 14% sucrose, 5% cellulose, 6% protein, 4% ash, and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, about 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.[29]
Fresh chicory root may contain between 13 and 23% inulin, by total weight.[30]

Agents responsible for bitterness[edit]
The bitter substances are primarily the two sesquiterpene lactones, lactucin and lactucopicrin. Other ingredients are aesculetin, aesculin, cichoriin, umbelliferone, scopoletin, 6,7-dihydrocoumarin, and further sesquiterpene lactones and their glycosides.[31]

Chicory root contains essential oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus Tanacetum.[32]
In traditional medicine, chicory has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies.[33] According to Cancer Research UK, "essence therapists believe that using essences can help to increase your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing ... Essences are not used to prevent, control, or cure cancer or any other physical condition."[34]

Forage[edit]
Chicory is highly digestible for ruminants and has a low fiber concentration.[35] Chicory roots are an "excellent substitute for oats" for horses due to their protein and fat content.[36] Chicory contains a low quantity of reduced tannins[35] that may increase protein utilization efficiency in ruminants.
Some tannins reduce intestinal parasites.[37][38] Dietary chicory may be toxic to internal parasites, with studies of ingesting chicory by farm animals having lower worm burdens, leading to its use as a forage supplement.[39][40][41] Although chicory might have originated in France, Italy, and India,[42] much development of chicory for use with livestock has taken place in New Zealand.[43]

Forage chicory varieties[edit]

Puna (Grasslands Puna)
Developed in New Zealand, Grasslands Puna is well adapted to different climates, being grown from Alberta, Canada, to New Mexico and Florida. It is resistant to bolting, which leads to high nutrient levels in the leaves in spring. It also has high resistance to grazing.
Forage Feast
A variety from France used for human consumption and also for wildlife plots, where animals such as deer might graze. It is very cold-hardy, and being lower in tannins than other forage varieties, is suitable for human consumption.
Choice
Choice has been bred for high winter and early-spring growth activity, and lower amounts of lactucin and lactone, which are believed to taint milk. It is also use for seeding deer wildlife plots.
Oasis
Oasis was bred for increased lactone rates for the forage industry, and for higher resistance to fungal diseases such as Sclerotinia.[clarification needed]
Puna II
This variety is more winter-active than most others, which leads to greater persistence and longevity.
Grouse
A New Zealand variety, it is  used as a planting companion for forage brassicas. More prone to early flowering than other varieties, it has higher crowns more susceptible to overbrowsing.
Six Point
A United States variety, it is very similar to Puna.
History[edit]
The chicory plant is one of the earliest cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance").[44] In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importation of coffee into Prussia, leading to the development of a coffee substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Förster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795, 22 to 24 factories of this type were in Brunswick.[45][46] Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779[47] as the "chicoree", which the French cultivated as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France, chicory frequently appeared as an adulterant in coffee, or as a coffee substitute.[48] Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, has been on sale since 1885.
The cultivated chicory plant has a history reaching back to ancient Egyptian time.[citation needed] Medieval monks raised the plants and when coffee was introduced to Europe, the Dutch thought that chicory made a lively addition to the bean drink.
In the United States, chicory root has long been used as a substitute for coffee in prisons.[49] By the 1840s, the port of New Orleans was the second-largest importer of coffee (after New York).[48] Louisianans began to add chicory root to their coffee when Union naval blockades during the American Civil War cut off the port of New Orleans, thereby creating a long-standing tradition.[48]
A common meal in Rome, puntarelle, is made with chicory sprouts.[50] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports that chicory is a native plant of western Asia, North Africa, and Europe.[4]
Chicory is also mentioned in certain silk-growing texts. The primary caretaker of the silkworms, the "silkworm mother", should not eat or even touch it.[citation needed]
The chicory flower is often seen as inspiration for the Romantic concept of the Blue Flower (e.g. in German language Blauwarte ≈ blue lookout by the wayside). It could open locked doors, according to European folklore.[51]

Cichorium intybus, commonly known as chicory, is well known as a coffee substitute but is also widely used medicinally to treat various ailments ranging from wounds to diabetes. Although this plant has a rich history of use in folklore, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.1. IntroductionThe genus Cichorium (Asteraceae) consists of six species with major distribution areas in Europe and Asia [1]. In several Asteraceae, inulin, a β-2,1 linked fructose polymer with a terminal glucose residue, functions as a reserve carbohydrate in stems, tubers, and taproots [2]. Cichorium intybus L., commonly known as chicory, is an erect fairly woody perennial herb, around 1 m in height with a fleshy taproot of up to 75 cm in length and large basal leaves [1, 3]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the root of C. intybus contained up to 40% inulin, which has a negligible impact on blood sugar and thus is suitable for diabetics [4]. To date, C. intybus is grown for the production of inulin on an industrial scale [2]. The name of the plant is derived from Greek and Latin. Cichorium means field and intybus is partly derived from the Greek “to cut”, because of the leaves, and partly from the Latin tubus to indicate the hollow stem [5].Chicory is a hardy plant and can endure extreme temperatures during both vegetative and reproductive growth stages [1]. When broken, all plant parts exudate a milky latex [3]. Cichorium intybus is cultivated for numerous applications and can be divided into four main varieties or cultigroups according to their use [6]: (1) “industrial” or “root” chicory, predominantly cultivated in northwestern Europe, India, South Africa, and Chile, produces the taproot as a coffee substitute or for inulin extraction; (2) “Brussels” or “witloof” chicory is commonly cultivated around Europe as industrial chicory for etiolated buds (chicons) by forcing; (3) “leaf” chicory is used as fresh or cooked vegetables; and (4) “forage” chicory, initially derived from wild chicory commonly found along roadsides and waste areas, has been used since the mid-1970s to intensify herbage obtainability in perennial pastures for livestock.
Cichorium intybus is a medicinally important plant in Eurasia and in parts of Africa. Despite its long tradition of use, the plant is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in any official Pharmacopoeia of a European Union member state [5]. However, due to its prevalent distribution, different parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicines globally [7]. Important phytochemicals are distributed throughout the plant, but the main contents are present in the root [1]. This review focuses on the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemical composition are discussed in detail.2. Traditional UsesMedicinal plants have been used for centuries and numerous cultures still rely on indigenous medicinal plants to meet their primary health care needs. It is likely that the insightful knowledge of plant-based remedies in traditional cultures advanced through trial and error and that the most important cures were carefully passed from one generation to another [8]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant [9] and it has had a long history of therapeutic use both in areas where it is indigenous and in areas where it has been introduced. The various common or local names describing this plant may be ascribed to the widespread use by different folkloric groups. Different preparations of this plant are employed to treat various symptoms and ailments (Table 1). The juice is said to be a folk remedy for cancer of the uterus and for tumors [4]. In South Africa, although it is considered a widespread weed, leaves, stems, and roots are made into a tea for jaundice and chicory syrup is used as a tonic and purifying medicine for infants [3]. In Turkey, an ointment is made from the leaves for wound healing [10]. Decoction refers to a preparation that is made by adding cold water to the plant material which is then boiled and allowed to simmer for 5–10 min after which it is strained [8]. Chicory decoctions are traditionally made from individual plant parts and/or from the plant as a whole (Table 1).Table 1Traditional medicinal uses of Cichorium intybus.CountryTraditional use(s)Plant part(s)Preparation(s)ReferenceAfghanistanMalariaRootAqueous extract[12]

Prior to the wars in Afghanistan, folkloric reports described the use of aqueous root extracts as a light-sensitive plant remedy for malaria. This indigenous knowledge has since been confirmed and the antimalarial compounds of C. intybus roots have been identified as the light-sensitive sesquiterpene lactones lactucin and lactucopicrin [12]. The flowers of the chicory plant (Cichorii flos) are used as a herbal treatment of everyday ailments such as a tonic and appetite stimulant and as a treatment of gallstones, gastroenteritis, sinus problems, cuts, and bruises [4]. In Italy, the whorls are made into a decoction and used as a depurative [13]. Chicory seeds are one of the main ingredients of Jigrine, a commercial product of India used for the treatment of various diseases of the liver [14]. Other plant parts are also used for liver disorders, namely, aerial parts in Bosnia and Herzegovina [15] and roots in Serbia and India [16, 17].3. Chemical ConstituentsChicoric acid has been identified as the major compound in methanolic extracts of chicory (Table 2) [18]. Aliphatic compounds and their derivatives comprise the main fraction while terpenoids comprise minor constituents of the plant. The flowers of chicory contain saccharides, methoxycoumarin cichorine, flavonoids, essential oils [4], and anthocyanins contributing to the blue colour of the perianth [19]. Table 2 provides a summary of the compounds isolated and identified from chicory. Octane, n-nonadecane, pentadecanone, hexadecane, and a tentatively identified compound have been found as principal volatile components [4]. A list of volatile compounds is given in Table 3.Table 2Compounds isolated and identified from Cichorium intybus (chicory).CompoundReference(s)Lactucin [12, 31, 103] Lactucopicrin[12, 31]8-Deoxylactucin[31, 104]Jacquilenin[103]11β,13-Dihydrolactucin[103]11,13-Dihydrolactucopicrin[103, 104]Crepidiaside B [103]Cyanidin 3-O-p-(6-O-malonyl)-D-glucopyranoside[105]3,4β-Dihydro-15-dehydrolactucopicrin[103]Magnolialide[103]Ixerisoside D[103]Loliolide[103]Cichorioside B[103, 104]Sonchuside A[103, 104]Artesin [103]Cichoriolide[103]Cichorioside[103]Sonchuside C [103]Cichopumilide[103]Putrescine[83]Spermidine[83]

Cichorium intybus presents a little investigated plant in terms of phytochemistry and pharmacology. Over 100 individual compounds have been isolated and identified from this plant (Table 2), the majority of which are from the roots. Most of the pharmacological studies on this plant document the testing of aqueous and/or alcoholic extracts only. Apart from the pharmacologically important activities, the use of C. intybus (hairy root cultures) has also been implicated in the phytoremediation of DDT [20].4.1. Antimicrobial ActivityThe antibacterial activity of the organic acid-rich extract of fresh red chicory (C. intybus var. sylvestre) was tested against periodontopathic bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Prevotella intermedia. The compounds identified from the active extract include oxalic acid, succinic acid, quinic acid, and shikimic acid. All of the organic acids were found to decrease biofilm formation and adhesion of bacteria to the cells, with different levels of efficacy. These compounds also induced biofilm disruption and detachment of dead cells for the cultured substratum [21]. In other reports on the antimicrobial activity of C. intybus, the crude aqueous and organic seed extracts were found to be active against four pathogenic microorganisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, and root extracts had pronounced effects on Bacillus subtilis, S. aureus, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and E. coli [22, 23]. The leaf extract of C. intybus also showed a moderate activity against multidrug resistant S. typhi [24]. Guaianolides-rich root extracts of C. intybus have shown antifungal properties against anthropophilic fungi Trichophyton tonsurans, T. rubrum, and T. violaceum [25]. A sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin cichoralexin isolated from chicory exhibited potent antifungal activity against Pseudomonas cichorii [26].4.2. Anthelmintic ActivitySeveral studies have been conducted on grazing animals to determine the anthelmintic potential of secondary metabolites present in C. intybus. Grossly, it has been concluded that the animals grazing on chicory have a higher performance index and lower incidence of gastrointestinal nematode infestations. In the majority of the experiments, the condensed tannins and sesquiterpene lactones were responsible for anthelmintic activity [27]. Anthelmintic activity of chicory has also been noticed in the case of lambs wherein the total number of abomasal helminths was found to be lesser in the lambs grazing on this plant [28]. The condensed tannin and sesquiterpene-rich extracts of C. intybus were evaluated for their efficacy against the larvae of deer lungworm, Dictyocaulus viviparous and other gastrointestinal nematode larvae using a larval migration inhibition assay. A dose-dependent decrease in the larval motility was observed in both lungworm and gastrointestinal nematodes [29]. The sesquiterpene lactone-rich extracts of C. intybus were also found to inhibit egg hatching of Haemonchus contortus [30].4.3. Antimalarial ActivityThe infusion of fresh roots of C. intybus has a history of use as a remedy for malarial fevers in some parts of Afghanistan. The bitter compounds in the plant, namely, lactucin, lactucopicrin, and the guaianolide sesquiterpenes, isolated from aqueous root extracts of chicory were concluded to be the antimalarial components of the plant. Lactucin and lactucopicrin completely inhibited the HB3 clone of strain Honduras-1 of Plasmodium falciparum at concentrations of 10 and 50 μg/mL, respectively [12, 31].4.4. Hepatoprotective ActivityThe folkloric use of C. intybus as a hepatoprotectant has been well documented. It is one of the herbal components of Liv-52, a traditional Indian tonic used widely for hepatoprotection. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted on cirrhotic patients, Liv-52 medication reduced the serum levels of hepatic enzymes, namely, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. It also reduced the Child-Pugh scores and ascites significantly [32]. Another polyherbal formulation, Jigrine, contains the leaves of C. intybus as one of its 14 constituents. Jigrine was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activity against galactosamine-induced hepatopathy in rats. The pretreatment of male Wistar-albino rats with jigrine significantly reduced the levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and urea and increased the levels of blood and tissue glutathione. Histopathological examination of the liver revealed that jigrine pretreatment prevented galactosamine toxicity and caused a marked decrease in inflamed cells [33].The aqueous-methanolic extract of the seeds of C. intybus has been investigated for the hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in mice. It was found to decrease both the death rate and the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamyl pyruvate transaminase [34]. In analogous studies, the antihepatotoxic activity of the alcoholic extract of the seeds and aqueous extracts of the roots and root callus of C. intybus was estimated. The oral administration of these extracts in albino rats led to a marked decrease in the levels of hepatic enzymes. Also, histopathological examination of the liver showed no fat accumulation or necrosis after the treatment [14, 35]. Similar studies have established the hepatoprotective effect of esculetin, a phenolic compound, and cichotyboside, a guaianolide sesquiterpene glycoside reported from C. intybus [36, 37].The carbon tetrachloride and paracetamol-induced liver toxicities were also found to be counteracted by intraperitoneal administration of crude extracts and fractions of C. intybus. The methanol- and water-soluble fractions exhibited marked reductions in serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. In the same study, toxicity was induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with galactosamine and thioacetamide [38].The phenolic acid-rich seed extract of C. intybus was evaluated for its efficacy against hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro model of hepatic steatosis was created by incubation of the HepG2 cells with oleic acid leading to intracellular accumulation of fat. The seed extract was effective in decreasing the deposited fat from the cells in case of administration after the initial fat deposition (i.e., nonsimultaneous administration with oleic acid). However, in case of simultaneous administration of seed extract and oleic acid, the extract could not protect the cells from steatosis except at very high doses. The extract also led to the increased release of glycerol (an indicator of triglyceride degradation) in steatotic cells. In case of nonsimultaneous administration, the extract was found to upregulate the expression of SREBP-1c and PPAR-α genes leading to restoration of normal levels of corresponding proteins. In the in vivo model of hepatic steatosis, namely, diabetic rats, treatment with seed extract resulted in significant decrease in fat accumulation and fibrosis [39].The hepatoprotective activity of C. intybus has been correlated to its ability to inhibit the free radical mediated damage. A fraction prepared from the ethanolic extract of the leaves was assessed for preventive action on the free radical mediated damage to the deoxyribose sugar of the DNA (obtained from calf thymus). A dose-dependent decrease in the DNA damage was observed in the present assay [40].4.5. Antidiabetic ActivityChicory has reported antidiabetic activity [17, 41]. Based on the traditional use of C. intybus in diabetes mellitus, the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of the ethanol extract of the whole plant were investigated. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ethanol extract, at a dose of 125 mg/Kg body weight, significantly attenuated the serum glucose levels in the oral glucose tolerance test. A marked decrease in the serum triglycerides and cholesterol was also observed in the extract-treated rats. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found to be reduced in extract-treated diabetic rats as compared to untreated diabetic rats [17]. The antidiabetic effect of the aqueous seed extract of C. intybus has also been investigated. Early-stage and late-stage diabetes were differently induced in male Wistar albino rats by streptozotocin-niacinamide and streptozotocin alone, respectively. The treatment with chicory extract prevented weight loss in both early-stage and late-stage diabetic rats. Chicory-treated diabetic animals resisted excessive increase in fasting blood sugar (assessed by glucose tolerance test). Grossly, normalization of blood parameters, namely, alanine aminotransferase, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and glycosylated heamoglobin, was seen in these animals. In early-stage diabetic rats, chicory treatment led to the increase in insulin levels pointing toward the insulin-sensitizing action of chicory [42].Feeding the diabetic Wistar rats with C. intybus leaf powder led to a decrease in blood glucose levels to near normal value. C. intybus administration also decreased the malondialdehyde (formed by thiobarbituric acid) levels and increased glutathione content. Anticholinesterase activity was restored to near normal, brain lipopolysaccharide decreased, and catalase activity increased [43]. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid have been described as potential antidiabetic agents by increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells. Both compounds were also able to stimulate insulin secretion from an insulin-secreting cell line and islets of Langerhans. Another compound, chicoric acid, is also a new potential antidiabetic agent exhibiting both insulin-sensitizing and insulin-secreting properties [44].4.6. Gastroprotective Activity
C. intybus has been used in Turkish folklore for its antiulcerogenic potency. The aqueous decoction of C. intybus roots was orally administered to Sprague-Dawley rats 15 minutes before the induction of ulcerogenesis by ethanol. More than 95% inhibition of ulcerogenesis was observed in the test group [45].4.7. Anti-Inflammatory ActivityThe inhibition of TNF-α mediated cyclooxygenase (COX) induction by chicory root extracts was investigated in the human colon carcinoma (HT 29) cell line. The ethyl acetate extract inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-α mediated induction of COX-2 expression was also suppressed by the chicory extract [46].4.8. Analgesic ActivityLactucin, lactucopicrin, and 11β, 13-dihydrolactucin exhibited analgesic action in mice in hot plate and tail-flick tests. In the hot plate test, all three compounds exerted an analgesic effect, with lactucopicrin being the most potent compound. In the tail-flick test, the antinociceptive effects of all the tested compounds (30 mg/kg dose) were comparable to that of ibuprofen (60 mg/kg dose). Lactucin and lactucopicrin were also established to have some sedative action as evident from the decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in mice [47].4.9. Antioxidant ActivityThe DPPH radical scavenging activity of a polyphenols-rich fraction of C. intybus has been investigated [48]. The anti- and prooxidant activities of Cichorium species were studied in chemical as well as biological systems. In the case of chemical systems, the antioxidant activity of water-soluble compounds in C. intybus var. silvestre was established in the coupled model of linoleic acid and β-carotene. A pro-oxidant activity of some of the chemical components was recorded initially which notably diminished with time and/or thermal treatment. Thereafter, the antioxidant activity of the raw juice and its fractions persisted. The molecular weight ranges of the antioxidant fractions of raw juice were also identified based on dialysis [49]. Two varieties of chicory, namely, C. intybus var. silvestre and C. intybus var. foliosum, have been investigated for their antioxidant (antiradical) activities in two distinct biological systems. The lipid peroxidation assay has been carried out on microsome membranes of rat hepatocytes after the induction of oxidative damage by carbon tetrachloride. The antiradical activity was expressed as the protective activity against lipid peroxidation and calculated as the percentage decrease in hydroperoxide degradation products. The second biological system used was the cultures of S. aureus after treatment with cumene hydroperoxide. The percentage increase of growth of bacteria was noted after the treatment with juices of chicory varieties. In both systems, the juices of chicory varieties showed strong antiradical activities [21, 49].Red chicory (C. intybus var. silvestre) was studied for its polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by using the synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical and three model reactions catalyzed by pertinent enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species, namely, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and diaphorase. Total phenolics were significantly correlated with the antioxidant activity evaluated with both the synthetic radical and the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. On a molar basis, red chicory phenolics were as efficient as Trolox (reference compound) in scavenging the synthetic radical [50]. The aqueous-alcoholic extracts of the aerial parts of C. intybus also inhibited xanthine oxidase enzyme dose dependently [51]. In another study, along with DPPH radical scavenging activity, C. intybus also exhibited inhibition of hydrogen peroxide and chelation of ferrous ion [52].4.10. Tumor-Inhibitory ActivityThe crude ethanolic extract of C. intybus roots caused a significant inhibition of Ehrlich tumor carcinoma in mice. A 70% increase in the life span was observed with a 500 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal dose of the tested extract [53]. The aqueous-alcoholic macerate of the leaves of C. intybus also exerted an antiproliferative effect on amelanotic melanoma C32 cell lines [54]. Magnolialide, a 1β-hydroxyeudesmanolide isolated from the roots of C. intybus, inhibited several tumor cell lines and induced the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells to monocyte or macrophage-like cells [55].4.11. Antiallergic ActivityThe aqueous extract of C. intybus inhibited the mast cell-mediated immediate allergic reactions in vitro as well as in vivo. This extract restrained the systemic anaphylactic reaction in mice in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction caused by anti-dinitrophenyl IgE in rats. Other markers of allergic reaction, namely, plasma histamine levels and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, decreased significantly whereas the levels of cAMP increased after the treatment with C. intybus extract [56].4.12. Other Pharmacologically Important ActivitiesThe ethanol extract of the roots of C. intybus is reported to prevent the immunotoxic effects of ethanol in ICR mice. It was noted that body weight gains were markedly decreased in mice administered with ethanol. However, the body weight was not affected when ethanol was coadministered with the ethanol extract of C. intybus. Similarly, the weights of liver and spleen were not affected when ethanol extract was given along with ethanol. A considerable restoration in the other markers of immunity, namely, hemagglutination titer, plaque forming cells of spleen, secondary IgG antibody production, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (in response to subcutaneous administration of sheep red-blood cells to paw), phagocytic activity, number of circulating leucocytes, NK cell activity, cell proliferation, and production of interferon-γ, was registered [57]. The immunoactive potential of an aqueous-alcoholic extract of the roots was established by a mitogen proliferation assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The extract showed an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of phytohemagglutinin and a stimulatory effect on MLR [58].Chicoric acid has shown vasorelaxant activity against nor-epinephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta strips [59]. A pronounced anticholinesterase activity of the dichloromethane extract of C. intybus roots was seen in the enzyme assay with Ellman's reagent. Two sesquiterpene lactones, namely, 8-deoxylactucin and lactucopicrin, also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of anticholinesterase [60]. The methanolic extract displays wound healing effect and β-sitosterol was determined as the active compound responsible for the activity, possibly due to its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibition [7].5. Toxicological StudiesAlthough C. intybus has a long history of human use, the high levels of secondary metabolites have shown potential toxicological effects. To evaluate the safety of the root extract of C. intybus, Ames test and subchronic toxicity assessment were conducted. The sesquiterpene-rich extract was evaluated for potential mutagenic properties (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA1535 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. Though cytotoxicity was observed at high extract doses in some strains, mutagenicity was not noted. A 28-day (subchronic) oral toxicity study, conducted in CRL:CD (SD) IGS BR rats, concluded that there was no extract-related mortality or any other signs of toxicological significance [61]. The toxicity evaluation of C. intybus extracts has also been done by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test (Microtox acute toxicity test). This bacterial test measures the decrease in light emission from the marine luminescent bacteria V. fischeri when exposed to organic extracts. The tested extracts showed less than 20% inhibition of bioluminescence and hence were concluded to be safe for human use [54].6. Clinical TrialsTwo clinical studies on chicory roots are reported in the literature, both of which are pilot studies and are therefore considered to be insufficient to support a well-established use indication for chicory root [5]. The first study, a phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating trial, was conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) [62]. In general, the treatment was well tolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highest dose of chicory had to discontinue treatment due to an adverse event. The results of the pilot study suggested that a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root has a potential role in the management of OA and merits further investigation. The second pilot study was conducted to assess whether chicory coffee consumption might confer cardiovascular benefits; thus, a clinical intervention was performed with 27 healthy volunteers, who consumed 300 mL chicory coffee daily for one week [63]. Depending on the inducer used for the aggregation test, the dietary intervention showed variable effects on platelet aggregation. Whole blood and plasma viscosity were both significantly reduced, along with serum MIF levels, after a week of chicory coffee intake. It was concluded that the full spectrum of the effects was unlikely to be attributed to a single phytochemical; nevertheless, the phenolics (including caffeic acid) are expected to play a substantial role. The study offered an encouraging starting-point to describe the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds found in chicory coffee.In the European Union, there is currently only one registered/authorized herbal medicinal product containing C. intybus as single ingredient whilst there are several combination products on the market [5]. The efficacy of herbal medicine Liv-52 consisting of Mandur bhasma, Tamarix gallica, and herbal extracts of Capparis spinosa, C. intybus, Solanum nigrum, Terminalia arjuna, and Achillea millefolium on liver cirrhosis outcomes was compared with the placebo for 6 months in 36 cirrhotic patients. The study concluded that Liv-52 possessed a hepatoprotective effect in cirrhotic patients. This protective effect of Liv-52 can be attributed to the diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulating properties of the component herbs [32].7. Cultivation and Sustainable UseGreeks and Romans began to grow chicory as a vegetable crop 4000 years ago [9]. Since the discovery in the 1970s that chicory root contains up to 40% inulin (polysaccharide), new strains have been created, with inulin content comparable to that of sugar beet [4]. It is a common vegetable in several Western European countries. It is typically grown in a biennial cycle, with a tuberised root produced during the vegetative growth phase [64]. During the first field year, the vegetative growth phase is characterized by the production of a fleshy taproot. The second field year is the generative phase in which the flowering stem is formed and seeds are produced. To produce the eatable leafy vegetable called a chicon, roots are harvested at the end of the first growing period when an appropriate stage of maturity is reached [65]. The application of inulin in the food industry was restricted to the production of coffee substitutes. It was later discovered that inulin could act as a substitute for sugar or fat due to its low caloric value. The most stable form for the commercialization of inulin is the powdered extract for its greater facility of manipulation, transport, storage, and consumption [66].Chicory is especially attractive as a cash crop since it can reach more than 62 t ha−1 under favourable conditions. Inulin content can reach on average 15% of root fresh weight and a yield of 8 t ha−1 of inulin is achievable [67]. The USA imports more than 2.3 million kilograms of chicons and 1.9 million kilograms of roasted chicory roots for coffee according to 2002 US Department of Commerce tariff and trade data [61]. Numerous studies have focused on different cultivation aspects of chicory. Chicory is considered one of the most important sources of inulin since it has a high root yield potential and also a high root sugar content [68]. A high root yield, a high inulin content, and especially long inulin chains are preferred [69]. Short chain inulin is used for the production of fructose syrup used in sweetening of cold drinks whereas long chain inulin is used as fat replacer and foam stabilizer in food products and also in the production of carboxymethyl inulin [2]. The effect of fertilizers on the growth, development, and yield of chicory has been well studied. In general, increase of nitrogen (N) increases the growth and ultimately the yield, although a high application of N has a negative effect on especially some of the amino acids. Increased N application at levels of 200 kg N ha−1 leads to a decrease in amino acids such as threonine and valine with a pronounced decreased effect on methionine. A level of 100 kg N ha−1 is preferred for enhanced quality [70]. In terms of phosphorous (P), it has been established that chicory has at least two inherent patterns of response to low or zero P conditions. One pattern is the classical increase in the length of the smallest diameter roots in response to P deficient conditions. The second pattern is a significant decrease in root tissue density under low P conditions [71]. It has also been investigated as a suitable catch crop since it has the ability to withdraw N, especially nitrate, from the soil, thereby reducing potential leaching. Additionally, it can withstand competition, has a slow juvenile development and vigorous growth after harvest of the main crop, is frost- and winter-hardy, has a well-developed root system, and does not transmit pathogens or pests to other crops [72]. Canopy closure in chicory is advantageous and critical for yield and can be achieved by a larger supply of assimilates to the shoot [73].Chicory is greatly influenced by the pH of the soil as this affects the availability of nutrients in the soil to the plant. A study conducted by Anguissola Scotti el al. [74] on two soils of pH, 5.7 and 7.0 indicated that the fly-ash or metal availability to the plant was significantly different at the different pH levels. At a low pH a decrease of Zn, Cu, Cd, and Ni was observed and for neutral soils the added metals are more available to plants than those naturally occurring in soils [75]. Chicory is a cold-requiring long-day plant [72]. In a study by Amaducci and Pritoni [68], it was shown that retarding harvest time significantly affects the content and concentration of inulin. Rainfall has proven to be another important factor since the roots contain a higher water content, thereby affecting the concentration of inulin in the roots. The same results have been obtained in a study by Baert [69] where an early sowing date and harvesting time increased the root yield, total sugar content, and inulin chain length. The increase in yield with an earlier sowing date was up to 30% higher with an increase of 10% with an earlier harvest date. The content of free fructose and sucrose increased and the content of free glucose and inulin decreased with a later harvest time [75].Even though chicory is a cold-requiring plant, cold storage after harvest can cause a strong decrease in free glucose, an increase in free fructose and sucrose, and hydrolysis of inulin [76]. This has also been observed by Ernst et al. [77] where an onset of cooler temperatures and especially colder temperatures during storage resulted in an increase in sucrose and fructose content. It was found that sucrose increased in the roots of chicory about threefold and fructose increased about tenfold within the first few weeks of cold storage after harvest [77]. The effect of storage at reduced temperature has also been studied on the levels of sesquiterpene lactones. Storage at 2°C and 10°C for up to 13 days had no effect on the level of lactucin-like sesquiterpene lactones in the chicons and after 7 days of storage a slight increase of lactucopicrin content was observed [78]. Several types of discoloration, leaf edge damage, and extensive growth of the internal core can occur in the heads of chicory during postharvest storage, which considerably reduces their market value. An atmospheric composition of 10% O2 and 10% CO2 in combination with a storage temperature of 5°C was found optimal [64]. Low temperature in the field also hastens and enhances bolting and flowering [79, 80]. The type and cultivar have been identified in numerous studies to be the determining factor during the stages of growth [81]. Suhonen [82] found the highest numbers of bolters in those being planted last, for which the mean temperatures during early growth were the highest.During the postharvest period, the major polyamines present are putrescine, especially in the oldest leaves, although spermidine is present in considerable amounts, showing a tendency to decrease with the increasing physiological age of the leaves. Free sterol content increases with postharvest and also with physiological age of the leaves. Sitosterol is the major free sterol present, followed by stigmasterol and campesterol [83].Emergence has been reported as one negative aspect of the crop, which could be addressed by specific breeding programmes [68]. Chicory can also be propagated and grown by means of micropropagation by regeneration of meristematic nodules. The leaves are cultivated in vitro and develop into plantlets when transferred to soil [84]. Although chicory can be regenerated in vitro from explants, both through organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, and from protoplasts, no transgenic plants have yet been reported that have been produced [85]. Promising potential utility technologies of the plant have emerged. Chicory roots pulps are an important by-product of the inulin processing industries and are usually used in animal feed. Other applications can be found for these materials since the extraction of chicory pulp yields high levels of pectin, a polysaccharide extensively used in food as a gelling agent, thickening agent, and stabilizer [86]. The crude protein content in chicory is more valuable than in alfalfa. Furthermore the crude lipid in chicory is generally higher than most varieties of alfalfa [9]. It also has a nutritional quality comparable to lucerne, with a mineral content superior for copper and zinc, with similar proportions of protein, lipid, minerals, and other nutrients, and palatable with good digestion with applicability in the poultry and livestock industry [87, 88].8. Conclusion
Cichorium intybus has a long tradition of use globally. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasionally used for animal forage. This multipurpose plant contains high amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and mineral elements [9]. Inulin from chicory roots is considered a functional food ingredient as it affects physiological and biochemical processes resulting in better health and reduction of the risk of many diseases [89].To date, chicory remains an extremely versatile plant, amenable to genetic manipulation, and there is interest shown in genetically engineered chicory to obtain higher yields and create new potentials [1]. The documented indigenous knowledge relating to the various medicinal uses of chicory has been supported by phytochemical isolation and investigations into biological activity. Nonetheless, many of its constituents have not been explored for their pharmacological potential and further research is necessary to gain better understanding of the phytochemicals against various diseases [9]. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited; however, considering that the Asteraceae family is a known source of allergic problems, a contraindication for hypersensitivity should be included in the safety data [5]. Recent studies suggest the use of C. intybus as a biomonitor for heavy metals [90, 91]; considering that chicory enters the food chain, this plant should be used with caution. The apparent bioactivity of C. intybus shown in preclinical studies (both in vitro and in vivo) is a testament to its historical use in traditional medicine.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThe South African Medical Research Council, University of South Africa and the HOD, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India, are thanked for their support.References1.

Cichorium is a genus of plants in the dandelion tribe within the sunflower family.[4][2]  The genus includes two cultivated species commonly known as chicory or endive, plus several wild species.[5]

 Flower of common chicory (Cichorium intybus)
Common chicory (Cichorium intybus) is a bushy perennial herb with blue or lavender (or, rarely, white or pink) flowers. It grows as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and in North America, where it has become naturalized.  It is grown for its leaves, when it is known as leaf chicory, endive, radicchio, Belgian endive, French endive, or witloof.  Other varieties are grown for their roots, which are used as a coffee substitute, similar to dandelion coffee.
True endive (Cichorium endivia) is a species grown and used as a salad green. It has a slightly bitter taste and has been attributed with herbal properties. Curly endive and the broad-leafed escarole are true endives.
Cichorium is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including setaceous Hebrew character,  turnip moth, and the grass moth Diasemia reticularis.

Species[3]
Cichorium alatum Hochst. & Steud. - Europe, Arabian Peninsula, drier parts of Africa from Algeria to Namibia[6]
Cichorium bottae Deflers - Saudi Arabia, Yemen
Cichorium callosum Pomel - North Africa
Cichorium calvum Sch.Bip. ex Asch. - Egypt, Ethiopia, Palestine, Israel, Jordan
Cichorium dubium E.H.L.Krause	 - Europe
Cichorium endivia L. - Mediterranean
Cichorium hybridum Halácsy - Greece
Cichorium intybus L. - probably Europe; now very widespread invasive
Cichorium pumilum Jacq. - Mediterranean
Cichorium spinosum L. - Mediterranean
Formerly included[3] are several species[which?] now considered better suited to other genera: Aposeris, Arnoseris, Geigeria, Rhagadiolus and Tolpis.
